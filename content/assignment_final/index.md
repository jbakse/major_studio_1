# Assignment 4A — Final Project

The second half of the semester is dedicated to the Final Project and the related [Final Paper](../assignment_paper). 

### Final Project

For your final, you will conceptualize, prototype, design, develop and document a self-directed project. The nature of this project is up to you, and should reflect your personal design interests and values.

You will document your process and post to your personal portfolio blog throughout this project, including summaries of your research, creative decisions, questions posed by your prototypes, outcomes and responses from testing, and production decisions. This material will due along with the final form of your project.

**You must post significant process updates each week.**

The content of these posts will vary from student to student and from week to week. These posts should summarize the work you have done that week, along with any findings. I will assign *additional, specific* content or excercises to include during some weeks.

**Your weekly update is due before class each Monday.**

## Week 9 — Conceptualization + Research

Begin the work of conceptualizing your final project through primary and secondary research. This week you want to identify the broad direction of your project and look for interesting approaches to your work.

Combine desk research, field research, form studies, interviews, and other methods as fits your personal creative process. Think, read, write, make. 

**Document your research, process, and findings.**

*In addition* complete the following tasks and add them to your process blog. 

### Initial Project Direction

Answer the following questions. Each answer should be *at least* 50 words.

- What *domains* are you researching and investigating?
- Why are you interested in these domains?
- Who, specifically, will you create your work for?
- Where and how would it most likely be experienced?
- What is the *design purpose* of your project?
- Why is that purpose important to you?
- What are your primary educational goals for this class, this semester, and this program?
- What project priorities do those goals suggest?
- What criteria will you use to evaluate the success of your project?

### 3-5 Precedents

Identify and study 3-5 *precedents*. For each precedent write a 50—100 word description and collect links, images, video, and other documentation.

For each precedent, your description should answer the following questions:

- What is the precedent? Who created it? Why did they create it?
- How does the precedent relate to the work you will be making?
- How does the precedent inform your project? What have you learned from it?

## Week 10 — Design Values + Proposal


### Design Values

Read [John Sharp's](http://www.heyimjohn.com/design-values/) essay on design values and consider the "qualities and characteristics you want to embody in your work." 

Following the example in John's essay, develop a set of five design values. Write a title (1-6 words) and description (50-100 words) for each value.

<!-- Proposal Madlibs -->

### Proposal

Write a 500-1000 word project proposal outlining your intended direction for the final project. 

It should specifically address the following:

- *Context*: What are your areas of inquiry, what are you studying, and why?
- *Intention*: What (generally) do you plan to make, and why? How is this making a response to your inquiry?
- *Impact*: What is the goal of your project, why is it important, and why should we care?
- *Design Values*: What values will guide your process?

Your proposal should draw from your on-going design research and your writing workshops and assignments. 

**Your proposal must be reviewed and edited by at least one person. Credit your editor at the end of your proposal.**

Suggestions:
- Include a quote, properly cited. Your quote should clearly and specifically support a point in your proposal.
- Include images of your precedents. Use captions or specific references in your writing to connect each image and precedent to your larger point.
- Consider including other visuals and illustrations.
- Consider how subheadings may help clarify the structure of your proposal.
- Consider how layout and design can support your proposal.
- Include a hook, clear introduction, and clear conclusion.

Post your final proposal to your class website.



## Week 11 — Prototyping

Consider your project carefully and identify as many outstanding questions as you can. Identify three important questions that you can answer (or partly answer) through prototyping. Design, build, test, and document **at least three** prototypes.

For each prototype answer the following:

- What is the purpose of the prototype? What are you testing?
- What did you learn from making your prototype?
- What did you learn from testing your prototype?


## Week 12 — User Testing 

Design and build a new prototype. Test your prototype with five people. Learn from their experience through direct observation and interviewing. Document each interaction and interview as well as your findings. 

## Week 13 — PoC Prototyping 

Build a full *Narrative Complete Product* / *Minimum Viable Product*

## Week 14 — Iteration 

Refine your project.

## Week 15 — Iteration

Refine your project.
