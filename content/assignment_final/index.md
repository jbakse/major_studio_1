# Assignment 4A — Final Project


The second half of the semester is dedicated to the Final Project and the related Final Paper. 

### Final Project

For your final, you will conceptualize, prototype, design, develop and document a self-directed project. The nature of this project is up to you, and should reflect your personal design interests and values.

You will document your process and post to your personal portfolio blog throughout this project, including summaries of your research, creative decisions, questions posed by your prototypes, outcomes and responses from testing, and production decisions. This material will due along with the final form of your project.

**You must post significant process updates each week.**

The content of these posts will vary from student to student and from week to week. These posts should summarize the work you have done that week, along with any findings. I will assign additional specific content or excercises to include during some weeks.

**Your weekly update is due before class each Monday.**
