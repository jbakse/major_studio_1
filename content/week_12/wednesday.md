# Week 12 — Monday

## Preamble
*3:30—3:50*

Set up seats for discussion.

## Narrative Complete Product
*3:50-4:30*

Your Narrative Complete Product is due on Wednesday November 29th. 

This should be a complete, end-to-end version of your project that demonstrates each essential aspect of your project working together. We should be able to base a critique of your concept and execution on your NCP.

Based on feedback from your NCP you will continue to refine your project, creating a second more resolved execution for your final deliverable.


## Open Studio
*4:30-5:00*

Our next two classes will be open studio classes. You will use these these classes to collect feedback from your peers as you develop your project. Open studios will follow this format:

### Individual Presentations

We will begin with individual, informal presentations updating the class on your progress. 

**You must demonstrate progress at each open studio.** 

Presentation should be about 2 minutes long: show your latest efforts, describe them briefly, tell the studio what you want feedback on. Be specific about the feedback you need.

I will interupt some of these presentations for class discussion.

### Flexible Peer Support

You will then break into groups to discuss your projects and provide feedback in more depth.
