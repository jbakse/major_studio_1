# Week 2 Monday

Crit style worked well.

Crit and assignment introduction both ran somewhat long, cutting down time available for the research topic workshop. I ended up cutting down the amount of time allowed for mapping, writing questions, etc. 

Cutting down this time worked well, suggest shortening planned time for this in the future to allow more time for example/modeling each task.
