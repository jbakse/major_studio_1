## 7 in 7 review
*3:50â€”4:50*

### Instructor
Arrange class into 5 groups.

### Guided Discussion

**Group 1**  
  Constraints often encourage creativity. Select two responses and discuss how their constraints contributed to their conceptualization.

**Group 2**  
  Choose set of responses that you feel composes the most coherent body of work. Discuss how these responses work together, and their emergent themes.

**Group 3**  
  Some responses are best understood in the context of the larger project and the chosen constraints. Choose the best web presentation, and discuss how the presentation supports an understanding of the responses.

**Group 4**  
  Find two responses by different artists that have a strong conceptual similarity. Discuss this similarity.

**Group 5**  
  Choose two responses that you feel have high potential for further development. For each response, suggest three avenues for further investigation.

## Housekeeping

Did you:
- Attendance and Roster Verification

## Ideas in Form
*5:00-5:15*

Introduction and discussion of [7-in-7 assignment](../assignment_7_in_7), with focus on part 1.

## Supporting your Design with Research

It is common for questions to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.

- Will people understand what I'm doing?
- Has anyone done this before?
- How do I make this work?
- My project is related to X. What is X?
- Does anyone actually want this?
- How much will it cost?

Ideas for creative projects often emerge from insights gleaned from research.

Research is an *necessary tool* for designers who wish to make *good designs*.

## Choosing your Research Topic
<!--
It is common for research topics to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.  -->

### Broad Topics + Focused Topics

**Broad** topics are easier to find sources for, harder to master, and **boring**.

**Focused** topics are harder to find sources for, easier to master, and **interesting**.

Broad | Focused
--- | ---
The history of commercial aviation | The contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation (example from *Booth*)
J-pop | How the depiction of sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos
North American Cacti | Uses of cactus needles in North American indigenous cultures.


### Exploring Topic Focus

Consider the scope of your research topic. Is it too broad? Is it to narrow?

Begin with a clean sheet of paper.

1. Choose a topic suggested by one of your 7-in-7 responses, write that topic in the middle of your paper.
2. At the top of the page write a very broad phrasing of your topic.
3. At the bottom of the page write a very narrowly focused version of your topic.
4. Add a middle-broad topic.
5. Add a middle-focused topic.


Scope | Topic
--- | ---
Super Broad     | The complete history of music
Broad           | Japanese culture
Moderate        | J-pop idols
Specific        | How the depiction of sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos
Super Specific  | How visual references to Satanism are used in BABYMETAL's *Doki Doki Morning* music video.


### Domain Mapping and Reframing

Use mapping to explore the relationships between related ideas.

Begin with a clean sheet of paper.

1. Choose the best research topic from your list above.
2. Write down the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.
3. Brainstorm concepts suggested by each domain, adding them to your map.
4. Connect related concepts.
5. Look for interesting **overlaps**, **contrasts**, and **tensions**; mark them on your map.


## Researching your Topic

### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources

Type | Description
--- | ---
**Primary Source** | Original Artifacts, Firsthand Reports <br/> *original artwork, speeches, photographs, correspondence, research journals*
**Secondary Source** | Analysis + Discussion of Evidence <br/> *books, articles, reviews, commentaries*
**Tertiary Source** | Introductory Overview of Topic <br/> *encyclopedias, bibliographies, textbooks*

[University of Minnesota: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources](https://www.crk.umn.edu/library/primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources)

[Wikipedia: No Original Research Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research)


### Primary Research vs Secondary (Desk) Research

Type | Description
--- | ---
**Primary Research** | Based on Primary Sources and Direct Action <br/> *Conducting Interviews, Surveys, Experiments*
**Secondary Research** | Analysis + Discussion of Evidence <br/> *Reading Reports, Journals, Books, Periodicals*

### Primary Research Activities

Brainstorm possible primary research activities as a class.

## Presenting your Findings

You will present your findings with a 3-4 minute slide presentation.

### 0. Plan
Presenting in a short time requires planning and practice. Take the time to identify the most important information and make sure you have time to present everything you plan to.

### 1. Hook 'em
Before you get to the primary point, give us a reason to be interested.

### 2. Tell 'em What You'll Tell 'em

### 3. Tell 'em

### 4. Tell 'em what you told 'em
