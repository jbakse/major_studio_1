# Week 2 - Wednesday

## Preamble
*3:30 - 3:50*

Arrange seats in 5 groups of 3.

## 7 in 7 review
*3:50—4:50*

### Instructor
Arrange class into 5 groups.

### Guided Discussion
*Groups, 10 Minutes*

**Group 1**  Wei Chung + Yujie + Nicole  
  Constraints often encourage creativity. Select two responses and discuss how their constraints contributed to their conceptualization.

**Group 2**  Ting Fang + Nathan + Carla  
  Choose set of responses that you feel composes the most coherent body of work. Discuss how these responses work together, and their emergent themes.

**Group 3**  Yongqing + Minhye + George  
  Some responses are best understood in the context of the larger project and the chosen constraints. Choose the best web presentation, and discuss how the presentation supports an understanding of the responses.

**Group 4**  Wen Chi + Yasong + Leah  
  Find two responses by different artists that have a strong conceptual similarity. Discuss this similarity.

**Group 5**  Pratheek + Jin + Ruoshui  
  Choose two responses that you feel have high potential for further development. For each response, suggest three avenues for further investigation.

### Class Discussion
*Class, 20 minutes*

Groups lead discussion of work, starting from their assigned prompts.

## Housekeeping

Did you:
- Come to the right class? (Attendance and roster verification)
- Post your links to slack, and keep up with everyone's posts?
- Post your links to the [Assignment Matrix](https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/spreadsheets/d/1PUGHF2wfe7VnJfYr5eYh9nNO6ekzHLHUrzS6PIz_WQ4/edit?usp=sharing)?
- Reread the assignment when you thought you were done, to make sure you did all the right things?


## Break
*4:50-5:00*

## Ideas in Form
*5:00-5:15*

Introduction and discussion of [Ideas in Form](../assignment_ideas_in_form), with focus on part 1.

## Supporting your Design with Research
*5:15 - 6:00*

It is common for questions to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.

- Will people understand what I'm doing?
- Has anyone done this before?
- How do I make this work?
- My project is about to X. What is X?
- What do people think about X?
- Does anyone actually want this?
- How much will it cost?

Ideas for creative projects often emerge from insights gleaned from research.

Research is an *necessary tool* for designers who wish to make designs founded on *understanding*.

```
Today is just practice to introduce these tools, you should use these tools as you work through this—and every—project.

These are tools, not steps.
```

### Related Readings

The Craft of Research provides a great overview of how to approach academic research. I highly recommend this book. If you get it, get it in paperback so you can easily make bookmarks, highlights, and margin notes.

## Choosing your Research Topic
<!--
It is common for research topics to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.  -->

### Domains

Domains are areas of study in which a particular topic or project sits. Identifying the domains in which your project exists is important to understanding the relevant context for you work.

What domains were relevant to your 7-in-7 projects?

### Domain Mapping and Reframing
*Individual, 10 minutes*

Use mapping to explore the relationships between related ideas.

Begin with a clean sheet of paper.

1. Choose one of your 7-in-7 responses that you feel has potential for further development.
2. Write down the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.
3. Brainstorm concepts suggested by each domain, adding them to your map.
4. Connect related concepts.
5. Look for interesting **overlaps**, **contrasts**, and **tensions**; mark them on your map.
6. Write down research topics suggested by these relationships.


### Broad Topics + Focused Topics


**Broad** topics are easier to find sources for, harder to master, and **boring**.

**Focused** topics are harder to find sources for, easier to master, and **interesting**.

Broad | Focused
--- | ---
The history of commercial aviation | The contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation (example from *Booth*)
J-pop | How the depiction of sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos
North American Cacti | Uses of cactus needles in North American indigenous cultures.


### Exploring Topic Focus
*Individual, 5 minutes*

Consider the scope of your research topic. Is it too broad? Is it to narrow?

Begin with a clean sheet of paper.

1. Choose a topic suggested by your domain mapping exercise, write that topic in the middle of your paper.
2. At the top of the page write a very broad phrasing of your topic.
3. At the bottom of the page write a very narrowly focused version of your topic.
4. Add a middle-broad topic.
5. Add a middle-focused topic.


Scope | Topic
--- | ---
Super Broad     | The complete history of music
Broad           | Japanese culture
Moderate        | J-pop idols
Specific        | How the depiction of sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos
Super Specific  | How visual references to Satanism are used in BABYMETAL's *Doki Doki Morning* music video.

### Forming Questions
*Individual, 5 minutes*

Who? What? When? Where? How? Why? Why not? What if?



### A Research Statement
*Individual, 5 minutes*

> I am studying ____1_____  
> because I want to find out _____2_____  
> in order to | to support making _____3______.

1. Start by simply stating your focused research topic.
2. Explain what you do not know.
3. Explain why it is important. What happens if you don't find an answer.


## Researching your Topic
*6:00 - 6:15*

### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources

Type | Description
--- | ---
**Primary Source** | Original Artifacts, Firsthand Reports <br/> *original artwork, speeches, photographs, correspondence, research journals*
**Secondary Source** | Analysis + Discussion of Evidence <br/> *books, articles, reviews, commentaries*
**Tertiary Source** | Introductory Overview of Topic <br/> *encyclopedias, bibliographies, textbooks*

[University of Minnesota: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources](https://www.crk.umn.edu/library/primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources)

[Wikipedia: No Original Research Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research)


### Primary Research vs Secondary (Desk) Research

Type | Description
--- | ---
**Primary Research** | Based on Primary Sources and Direct Action <br/> *Conducting Interviews, Surveys, Experiments*
**Secondary Research** | Analysis + Discussion of Evidence <br/> *Reading Reports, Journals, Books, Periodicals*

### Primary Research Activities
*Class, 5 minutes*

Brainstorm possible primary research activities as a class.

## Presenting your Findings
*6:15—6:30*

You will present your findings with a 3-4 minute slide presentation.

### 0. Plan
Presenting in a short time requires planning and practice. Take the time to identify the most important information and rehearse to make sure you have time to present everything you plan to.

Almost all of your information should be conveyed by what you say, use slides sparingly to support what you say.

Don't put any text on your slides you don't expect us to read. Make sure you give us enough quiet time to read it.


### 1. Hook 'em
Before you get to the primary point, give us a reason to be interested.

### 2. Tell 'em What You'll Tell 'em
Briefly tell us what your presentation is about, and what we will know at the end. This helps us organize the information in our heads as you deliver it. For this presentation you might do this using the research statement template. In a presentation about your project you might show your finished project first.

### 3. Tell 'em
Convey your research findings. Specifically connect everything you tell us to the larger context and your main point.

### 4. Tell 'em what you told 'em
Bring your presentation to a clear conclusion.
