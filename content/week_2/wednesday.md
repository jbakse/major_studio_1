## Choosing your Research Topic

### Broad Topics + Focused Topics

Broad topics are easier to research and boring.

Focused topics are harder to research and interesting.

Broad | Focused
--- | ---
The history of commercial aviation | The contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation (example from *Booth*)
J-pop | How the depiction of male sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos
Cacti | Traditional uses of cactus needles


### Questions


### Exploring Topic Focus

Consider the scope of your research topic. Is it too broad? Is it to narrow?

Begin with a clean sheet of paper.

1. Choose a topic suggested by one of your 7-in-7 responses, write that topic in the middle of your paper.
2. At the top of the page write a very broad phrasing of your topic.
3. At the bottom of the page write a very narrowly focused version of your topic.
4. Add a middle-broad topic.
5. Add a middle-focused topic.

### Mapping Topics

Use mapping to explore the relationships between related ideas.

Begin with a clean sheet of paper.

1. Choose a suitable research topic from your list above.
2. Write down the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.
3. Brainstorm concepts suggested by each domain, adding them to your map.
4. Look for interesting **overlaps**, **contrasts**, and **tensions**; mark them on your map.
