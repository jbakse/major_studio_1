# Week 2 Monday

This day was almost entirely presentations
Even with two students and their presentations out, we ran long. Class went over by 30 minutes, while still feeling rushed.

The rubric feedback worked well, I think. It didn't always fit the issues in the presentation very well, sometimes did.

Having a panel assigned for each review to start off the conversation worked well.

It worked better at the beginning, people got tired from concentrating and the repetition by the end. Conversation towards the end felt more rushed and duller.

I don't want to break up the presentation, but it might be necessary with 15 students.

Another option would be to not give individual feedback, but we need time for that as well.


 # Week 3 Wednesday

Time is still running short. Went over 5 minutes.

I hadn't specifically planed on this, but I had students answer some of the questions in the class notes individually in their sketchbooks. I gave them about 90 seconds for about 5 of the questions. Things like "What things did you do to decide what to make for this study? (design verbs)" and "What did you learn from making this Study that informs your larger research?"

Later, when I talked about their project webpage and keeping it up to date, I suggested mining those writing exercises for things to write to support their work.

Got asked after class: "Why are we going so fast? I want to spend more time on these projects."

My answer: 1) We have so much to do, we need to move fast. 2) We are not really moving fast, these are not projects, they are studies, sketches, prototypes. This is part of the process of understanding your project domain and the relationship between form, content, and intent. We are practicing tools and a process for thinking through a problem before trying to solving it. We are learning not to move to fast.

Also got asked after class: "For the 'interactive' study, how can I make [project idea] in only a week?"

Answer: You can't. [Project idea] is too big and complicated for a week. You shouldn't be thinking anywhere near that complex. You shouldn't even be making a simple project. You should be making a study that focuses on one aspect the relationship between form/content/intent. 

Also, don't go digital. Baseballs, board games, and bricks are all interactive, and you could make those things in a week.
