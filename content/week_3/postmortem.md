# Week 2 Monday

This day was almost entirely presentations
Even with two students and their presentations out, we ran long. Class went over by 30 minutes, while still feeling rushed.

The rubric feedback worked well, I think. It didn't always fit the issues in the presenation very well, sometimes did.

Having a panel assigned for each review to start off the conversation worked well.

It worked better at the beginning, people got tired from concentrating and the repetition by the end. Conversation towards the end felt more rushed and duller.

I don't want to break up the presentation, but it might be necessary with 15 students.

Another option would be to not give individual feedback, but we need time for that as well.
