# Many Projects

Working alone, create a self-directed project that builds on the research you have just completed with your team.

Begin by creating a new research statement which will guide your project. Choose a format/media for your project that supports your research goal. Spend most of your time creating (not planning, researching, or analyzing).

After you complete your project, prepare a 5 minute presentation that explains your project and addresses your research statement. For this presentation address us a studio peers already familiar with the assignment and your research project.

### Just Read It
Read the whole text before suggesting any edits. Focus on meaning.

### Identify the Topic
Identify the main topic of the text. You are looking to find the topic that is discussed the most, not the most interesting or best supported topic. Take a moment to briefly state this topic.

**Write the topic at the top of the paper. Try to use 5 words or fewer.**

### Identify the Thesis Statement
A thesis statement states the central message of text. A strong thesis statement should be clear, concise, specific, and definite. It should also be interesting.

Generally, the thesis statement is placed at the end of the introduction, where it can lead in to the main body of the text.

Find the sentence that best states the central message, this is likely the Thesis Statement. For now, ignore strong sentences that do not state the central message.  

**Highlight the thesis Statement.**

### Review the Thesis Support
Read through the text again, focusing on how each sentence supports the thesis.

Identify weak sentences:
- Sentences that don't support the thesis.
- Sentences that are *unhelpfully* redundant.
- Sentences that equivocate (weasel words).
- Sentences that contain no meaning, beg the question, or are tautological.

**Call out weak sentences with margin notes.**

Identify missing information:
- Key information that would support the thesis.
- Unanswered questions.
- Missing connections between thoughts.
- Statements that support the thesis but need support themselves. [Citation Needed]

**Call out missing information with margin notes.**

Identify problematic ordering:
- Look for sentences that are out of place or unrelated to adjacent sentences.
- Look for sentences that could be moved to better support a weaker section in the text.
- Note when topic sentences that appear in the middle of paragraphs. Usually, they should open the paragraph.

**Call out ordering issues with margin notes.**


### Grammar and Spelling
These matter a great deal. Spelling and grammar mistakes disrupt reading and obscure meaning. Readers can often recover from simple mistakes, but will be left less confident in the writing.

Look for:
- misspellings
- grammar problems
- double words
- missing words
- incorrect punctuation
- awkward phrasing
- incorrect word usage

**Circle mistakes, note the nature of the mistake if you think it may not be obvious.**
