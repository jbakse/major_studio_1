# Week 3 - Wednesday

## Preamble
*3:30—3:50*

Arrange seats for pin-up discussion.

## Guest: Micheal Schober
*3:50-4:20*

Micheal Schober, Parson's Vice Provost for Research, will join us to discuss the ethics in design research.

## Makeup Presentation
*4:20-4:30*

## Pin-up Discussion
*4:30-5:00*


**Group 1**  Wei Chung + Yujie + Nicole  
    Choose two works that you think are interesting. Describe them in detail. Describe only what you can see. Avoid discussing intent or effect.

**Group 2**  Wei Chung + Yujie + Nicole  
    Choose two projects you think did the "right thing". What did they do? Did it work out?

**Group 3**  Wei Chung + Yujie + Nicole  
    Choose two projects that are outliers in some quality (e.g. size, purpose, approach, media, aesthetic). For each, describe what the artist did differently, and what the effect of that choice is.

**Group 4**  Wei Chung + Yujie + Nicole  
    Choose two works that you feel have different purposes. What is the purpose of each work? What decisions has the artist made to support that purpose?





## Break
*5:10—5:20*

## Framing 
*5:20-5:50*

### Assignment Styles

Style                   | Focus
---                     | ---
Step-by-Step            | What to do
Specifications          | What to make
Problem Description     | What to solve
Theme                   | What to explore 
Open                    | When it's due

You will often encounter very open problems, assignments, and briefs.

- Self-initiated research
- Grant Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
- Clients often don't know what they need. 
- Clients often think they need something they don't.
- Product and business development
- Your Thesis


### Self-Similar Design Process

The 2D phase of this assignment was much more open than the research phase. Without many specifics, you had to figure out what to do for yourself. Figuring out what to do is often the most critical part of the design process.

Designing is largely about creating solutions to problems.

Not knowing what to do is a problem. Use design to create a solution.

- What did you start with?
- How did you decide what to do?
- Did you use any of the tools or methods that we've discussed in class?
- **Did you do any primary or secondary research?**
- What other tools and methods did you use?
- Do you have a personal process for getting started?

### Studies

Studies are small works created to explore the relationship between form, subject, and purpose. The primary reason to create studies is to develop insight.

- How are studies related to prototypes? to sketches?
- How did your research inform your 2D project?
- How did your 2D project inform your research?

### Purpose

Most things we make are designed to achieve one or more purposes. If you don't understand your purpose, your design is unlikely to achieve it.




## Ideas in Form 3D Ideation
*5:50-6:30*

## Brainstorm design purposes
*10 minutes*
Brainstorm design purposes.

<!-- Inform, Persuade, Entertain, Enable, Confuse, Engage, Inspire, Teach, Learn, Understand -->

### Populate a Matrix
*10 minutes*

- Choose three design purposes you are interested in exploring.
- Choose three topics/questions/insights/issues from your research. Choose a single work to represent them.

- Create a 3 x 3 matrix.
- Label the top with your three chosen design purposes.
- Label the side with your three chosen issues.
- For each combination of purpose and issue write down a potential 3D project idea.


### Share
*20 minutes*

- Share your best idea
- Share your worst idea
- Share an idea that is ridiculous, impossible, or otherwise "wrong".
