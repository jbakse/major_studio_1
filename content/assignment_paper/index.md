# Assignment 4B — Final Paper

In conjunction with your [Final Project](../assignment_final) you will write a final paper that explores similar themes.

Your paper should describe the project's core concept and questions. Articulate a clear opinion in response to those questions, and defend that opinion and your final project work through a presentation of research. The paper is not simply a project description or a research compilation. It must be structured as an argument that uses research to prove the point you are seeking to make through you work.

## Specifications
- 1500—2500 words
- Cite a minimum of 5 research sources, excluding Wikipedia and other tertiary sources
- Format citations as endnotes in Chicago Turabian style
- All papers must be edited for grammar

**Critical Note** You are *required* to meet with writing center staff *before submitting your rough draft* to get feedback on the development of your argument, assistance with citing your sources, and help with editing and grammar. You may work with another editor with written instructor approval.
