# Week 5 Monday

Reviewed interactive portion of Ideas in Form.

Student work was ambitious, most with code and/or pcomp components. Impressive work overall.

Introduced and discussed instruction sets. Recon Planning Workshop went well.

Class timing was fine. 


# Week 5 Wednesday 

Pin up discussion was fine, nothing particular to report.

I was called away for most of the ideation workshop to address an emergency, class conducted workshop on their own. I returned near the end of the class period to check in, it seemed to go pretty well, but would have been better with a little more guidance and more time for discussion at the end.
