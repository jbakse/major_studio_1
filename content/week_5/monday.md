## Due Next TIME: Proposal

**Post (Slack or Site+Slack):** Your 10 Ideas

3 written proposals explaining your proposed interventions:

- Brief introduction to the space
- Motivation for intervention
- Description of the intervention
- User story
- Approach to non-verbal instruction giving
- Brief criteria for success

You may include visual illustrations (such as a map of the space), but primarily this is a written summary of the idea.

I suggest working together as a team to develop your top 3 ideas for 10-15 minutes each, then splitting up and having each member write a proposal, then work together to improve, rewrite, edit your final proposals.
