# Week 11 — Monday

## Preamble
*3:30—3:50*

Set up room for paper prototyping.


## You are Here
*3:50—4:10*

You have written your proposal!

In the process you have:

- identified an area of inquiry and located it within domains
- researched your domains through reading and making
- found precedents to inform your process
- identified your target audience
- identified your desired impact
- proposed an initial concept and direction

This represents a lot of work and has given you a much more informed perspective about your project than you had two weeks ago.

**Do not change horses midstream.**

Your proposal should anchor and guide your process from here forward. It can be tempting to scrap an idea when you are facing difficulties and see another idea you believe will work better. Often the other idea isn't as easy at it seems, and you always lose time and insights in the process.

What you will do next:

- identify core design questions related your project
- explore these questions through prototyping



## What is a Prototype?
*4:10—4:30*

Artists and Designers often make many things in the course of a project: Studies, Sketches, Drafts, Surveys, Storyboards, Wireframes, Mockups, Renderings, User Stories, Treatments, Models, Outlines, Animatics


### Prototypes

Houde and Hill define prototypes as
> ...any representation of a design idea, regardless of medium.  
> This includes a preexisting object when used to answer a design question.

I think of prototypes this way:
> Prototyping is one of the tools designers use to test ideas.  
> A prototype should **test one or more characteristics** of a possible design.  
> A prototype should **embody the characteristics** being tested.



## What to Prototype
*4:30—4:50*

You should use prototypes to explore and test important aspects of your project. Focus on the aspects that are both the **most important** and the **least clear**. Important aspects need to be tested even if you think you know the best way to address them; unclear aspects become clearer through testing.

The first step in creating a prototype is identifying your project's important open design questions. Consider your project and its purpose, focus on important areas, and list questions that need to be answered.

This formula may help articulate the purpose for your prototypes:

> I am in the early stages of designing ______________.   
> A core consideration for this project is _____________________.  
> Specifically, I want to find out __________________.  


I am in the early stages of designing **software to visualize room layouts**.
A core consideration for this project is **how users will position furniture in the visualizer**.
Specifically I want to find out **what types of manipulations users need to make**.


I am in the early stages of designing **a workshop to teach html/css**.
A core consideration for this project is **what kind of in-class assignment to use**.
Specifically I want to find out **if having students re-create a poster in html/css will be effective**.


I am in the early stages of designing **a device for scientists to use in their field work**.
A core consideration for this project is **portability**.
Specifically, I want to find out **if a scientist working alone can easily transport the device from their lab to the field**.


## Break
*4:50—5:00*

## Prototype Planning Workshop
*5:00—6:30*

### Brainstorm Prototype Statements
*Individually, 20 minutes*

Consider your project and write down as many "core considerations" as you can. For each consideration write at least one thing you would like to learn through prototyping. Organize your thoughts using the template above.

### Propose Prototypes
*Groups, 20 minutes*

Share your prototype statements with your team. Work together to propose prototypes that would inform your project and answer your questions.

### Share Plan
*Class, 30 minutes*

Share one of your prototype statements with the class, and describe a prototype you might make.

## Due Wednesday

For Wednesday, identify a core aspect of your project to prototype and **create** a prototype to test this aspect. Bring your prototypes to class on Wednesday. We will use class time on Wednesday to **test** and **document** your prototypes.
