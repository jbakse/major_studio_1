# Week 4 Monday
Class went well. Timings worked as expected.

Class growing more comfortable with critique. The open crit portion went well.

Had one student follow up with me very confused about the studies.

She was asking why we didn't just do more book research, claimed she wasn't learning from making. We talked a long while, it seemed to make things more confused at first. I think for her the issue stemmed from me saying these "studies" were not "prototypes". She came from a design background, and understood the value of prototyping, but thought of them broadly. By excluding her broad understanding of prototypes, she couldn't figure out what I wanted. This was partly compounded by her being an english language learner.
