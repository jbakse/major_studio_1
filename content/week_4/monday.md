# Week 4 - Wednesday

## Preamble
*3:30—3:50*

Arrange for 3D response discussion.

Tables along back and side walls, chairs in the middle.

## 3D "Pin-up" Discussion
*3:50-4:50*

**Group 1**  Carla + Ruoshui + Jackie  
    
Choose two works that you think are interesting. Describe them in detail. Describe only what you can see. Avoid discussing intent or effect.

**Group 2**  Jin + Ting + Wen-Chi + Yujie
    
Choose two of the 3D studies. Discuss the relationship between the 3D study and the same artist's 2D Study.    

**Group 3**  Yasong + George + Pratheek + Nathan
    
Choose two projects that are outliers in some quality (e.g. size, purpose, approach, media, aesthetic). For each, describe what the artist did differently, and what the effect of that choice is.

**Group 4** Nicole + Leah + Jason + Min
    
Decide what you think the primary purpose of each piece on display is. State each purpose in 10 words or less.

**Open Discussion**

- What did you learn from your studies?
- What is the relationship between your form studies, your primary research, and your secondary research?
- How did working in 3D differ from working in 2D? 

## Break
*4:50—5:00*

## Why are we Working so Quickly?
*5:00—5:15*

1: We have a lot to do, we need to move quickly. 

2: We aren't.

If you think of the work we have been making as projects, we are moving very quickly. Today, three weeks in, you have each completed 10 projects in this class alone. A few hours a day, for two or three days is rarely enough time to to even research and conceptualize a project, let alone make it.

But we are not making projects. We are making sketches and studies. We are exploring ideas though making. To often we begin creative projects by deciding what to make. It is better to take some time to study our problem, consider our purpose, and explore our options first. As designers, we understand our work best when we combine research with making. We read, sketch, observe, prototype, interview, study, and draw. We want to take the time to become experts on our project before we rush to decide what to make. 
  
It feels like you are moving very quickly, but you are, in a way, *learning to slow down*. 


  
  

## Interaction Response
*5:15—5:30*

Discuss what to do in next phase of Ideas in Form.

For the last phase, you will make an interactive study to further your understanding of your research topic. 

- It can be physical or digital.
- It has to be something one can use.
- It has to work.
- It can be as simple as you like.

You have one week for this phase. This is the longest amount of time that you have had for an assignment so far. **Your greatest peril is trying to do something to complicated.** Your focus should not be solving a problem, but understanding it.
