# Assignment 1 - 7 in 7 Project

In today's class each of you will develop a method or constraint to guide the conceptualization of a daily project.

For the next seven days, create one project a day. Each project must be conceptualized, produced and documented in a single day. Each project must follow the constraint you develop in class. **These are the only rules of the project, and should not be bent or broken.**

- The projects may be all in the same medium, or utilize different media.
- The more experimental in nature, the better.
- There is no “wrong” way to do this project (other than break the two rules).

Take care to document the projects carefully, as you will present them in class. Additionally, you should blog on the conceptualization, development and outcome of your project each day and post links to your posts in the 7-in-7 channel on Slack. You should also make a post of your reflections on the experience as a whole.

Guiding Questions:
- When is a project fully complete? How do you know you are “finished” with a project?
- How does the framing of a project, its context, scope, and parameters, determine the
content created? What is the relationship between concept and execution?
- Upon reflection is there anything that ties your projects together? Can you see an
emergent theme in your work?
- After completing your projects what do you think could have been improved? If you were
to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?
