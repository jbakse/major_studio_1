# Assignment 1 - 7 in 7 Project

In today's class each of you will develop a small set of constraints to guide the conceptualization of daily projects.

### For the next seven days, create one project a day.

**Rule 1:** Each project must be conceptualized, produced, and documented in a single day.

**Rule 2:** Each project must follow the constraints you develop in class.

**These are the only rules of the project, and should not be bent or broken.**

### Deliverables:
- Document your projects each day. Your documentation will likely include images and a brief description, but other formats may fit your projects better.
- Create a page on your MS1 site for each project. Post links to these pages in *7_in_7* channel on slack.
-  Follow the *7_in_7* channel all week and comment on each other's work.
