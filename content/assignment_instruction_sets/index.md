# Assignment 2 — Instruction Sets for Strangers

Working in pairs, design an intervention for a space that enables strangers to interact.

1. Your intervention may not include written or spoken language.
2. Your intervention may be of any type, scale, or media.
3. Your intervention should be site specific.


You are working in public, represent the New School well. **Don't be a jerk.**

### Part 1 — Research + Observation

- Determine a public space away from the New School campus and research the location and its history.
- Observe and record the space and use a variety of visual strategies to map its use over time.
- Map, document and share the results of your observation. 


- What is the size, location of the space?
- What other physical characteristic are important?
- What modes of interaction are used within the space?
- What physical, social, personal, spatial, and cultural behaviors occur?
- What kinds of patterns arise from your observations?
- What opportunities does the space suggest?
