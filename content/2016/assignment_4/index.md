# Major Studio One: Final Project

The final 8 weeks of the semester are dedicated to the Final Project. This is a self-directed project that will be conceptualized, prototyped, designed, developed and documented. Document your process throughout, and post to your personal portfolio blog throughout, including creative decisions, questions posed by your prototypes, outcomes and responses from testing, production decisions, etc. This material will be compiled as a blog due along with the final build of your project.

## Final Paper

In addition to the final project, you will write a paper that should explain the project’s conceptual background & methodology by forming a clear argument based on a concise presentation of research. The paper is not simply a summary of your project, or a research compilation, it must be structured as an argument that uses research to prove the point students are seeking to make with their work.

We will introduce this part of the final later in the semester.

## Project Proposal (Written, Rough)
### Due Week 8
Investigate the following areas as they relate to your Final Project:

**Domains:** What are the domains, field(s), discipline(s) and/or medium(s)your project will occupy?

**Precedents:** What are three to five works that define this area? Think in terms of technologies, materials, experience, intention and subject domain.

**Audiences + Contexts:** For whom is this kind of work created? Where is it experienced?

**Process:** How will you go about conceptualizing, designing and prototyping your project?

**Research Question:** Given the research you have conducted, what is the question you hope to investigate through your Final Project?

Post an initial version of your written proposal to your site before Monday's class. Update, expand, and evolve this proposal as you develop your research.

## Project Proposal (Presentation)
### Due Week 9, to be presented at MIDTERMS

Update and expand your written project proposal.

Create a short presentation to introduce the class and our guest critic to your area of inquiry and initiate a conversation about your research and design project.



## Refined Concept
### Due Week 10
Based on feedback received on your proposal, prepare a revised concept statement or question along with a set of design values. When starting a research based project, it is important to consider: What are you studying? Why? What do you hope to accomplish through this study?

Write 3 sentences that articulate the context, intention and impact of your work:

**Context:** what are your areas of inquiry, what are you studying, and why?

**Intention:** what do you plan to make, and why? How is this making a response to your inquiry?

**Impact:** what is the goal of your project, why is it important, and why should we care?

Accompanying your statement or question is a set of design values. These are the characteristics you want your thesis project to embody, and for those experiencing to engage with and/or feel. Design values are useful tools for helping us stay on track with our goals for our projects. In the first draft of your design values, write a sentence or two for as many of the following as you can. By the end of the semester, you should have a solid list of design values in place to guide the production and polish of your project.

* Who is it for?
* Where do they encounter it?
* When do they experience it?
* What are they doing while experiencing it?
* What does the project ask of its audience?
* What do you want the audience to take away from their experience?
* What are some adjectives around how the project will make its audience feel?


## Prototype 1, Concept  
### Due Week 10
Based on feedback received on your proposal, create a rapid prototype out of paper, found materials or found objects that describes or tests a core aspect of your project’s concept. For each prototype you create, pose a question you have about your project that is answered in the prototype. These questions may be conceptual, technical, visual, about the medium, etc.

Everyone will present their prototypes and guiding questions in class.


## Prototype 2, Aesthetic  
### Due Week 11
Based on feedback received, create a second prototype that begins to dig more deeply into the project; addressing issues of form, aesthetics, or style. It should be accompanied by a revised Statement and set of Design Values.


## Prototype 3, Engagement  
### Due Week 12
Create a new prototype that embodies your current understanding of your project. It should address how you would like to engage audience, and what you would like them to experience. It does not need to be finished or feature complete. Along with this prototype, update your Concept Statement/Question and Design Values.


## Domain & Precedents Doc
### Due Week 13 (see below)


## Self Evaluation  
### Due Week 14
Based on the feedback received on all previous prototypes and your concept materials, outline answers to the following questions, which will be addressed in your 1x1 meetings.

a. What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?
b. What the five strengths of your project?
c. What are the five most critical issues for your project?
d. What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?
e. Can you intuitively ask some new questions?
f. What questions need to be answered in order to create a proof of concept prototype?
g. Are you on the right path or do you need to change direction, and if so, how will you do that?

<!-- ## Research paper draft, minimum 3 pages,
### Due Week 14
To be presented during 1x1 meetings. -->


## Proof of Concept Prototype  
### Due Week 15
The PoC prototype will be presented during mock presentations the week before finals.  It should address any core issues in concept or central problems in making you need to overcome via prototyping. This ‘just before prime time’ prototype demonstrates how you’ve addressed and overcome these critical issues through making.

<!-- ## Final Paper
### Due Week 15, see below -->


## Final Presentation
### Due Week 16
Produce a complete, functional, polished version of your project. It should be accompanied by an updated concept statement/question and design values. These will be presented at MS1 Final Critiques.

<!--
RESEARCH

## Research,
### Due Week 13
In order to more formally collect and document your research around your project, prepare a three-part document addressing the domains your project embodies, the important precedents for your project and an annotated bibliography.

1. Define your 2-4 central domains of interest and key areas of study, These can include scholarly and/or scientific disciplines, mediums, technologies, subject matter, styles, communities of practice, social/ governmental/ political infrastructures, etc. Write a 2-3 sentence synopsis for each domain and explain why they are important to you

3. Prepare an annotated works cited document that includes all important books, papers, articles, projects, artworks, films, games, etc. that relate to your thesis project. For each entry, provide a short explanation of the item, and how it informs your project.


WRITING

Final paper, Draft due week 14, final due week 15
The paper should defend the project-based work that students created in response to their design questions. The paper should explain the project’s conceptual background & methodology by forming a clear argument based on a concise presentation of research. The paper is not simply a summary of your project, or a research compilation, it must be structured as an argument that uses research to prove the point students are seeking to make with their work.

Goals
To become familiar with: how to define a domain or research area;  formulate progressively focused creative research questions about areas of interest; the nature of prototyping as testing a project stage or idea, rather than executing the final project itself; creative forms of testing with appropriate audience; writing as creative commentary that seeks to persuade or prove, rather than just summarize.

Questions to consider for the final paper:
What are the central questions / experiments you are interested to address, and how does your project address them? What is the context for your project; who else has made interesting work in this field, and how does your project relate to it? How are you countering, building on or deriving inspiration from that work? What are some open questions that your project attempted to solve that remain to be answered? -->
