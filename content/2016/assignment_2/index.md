# Assignment 2 - One Subject, Many Projects

## Part 1 - Teams

Working in groups of three or four, select a subject domain around which you would like to produce a small-scale project. Think broadly about domains—medium, toolsets, contexts, audiences, content, experience, problem set, data set, etc.

As a group, prepare a 20 minute presentation of your subject domain anchored by the following statement:

> We are studying _________  
> because we want to find out who/why/how __________  
> in order to understand how/why/what ___________.

(paraphrased from: Wayne c. Booth et al, The Craft of Research, 1995)

**Due:** Wednesday, September 14
**WIP Review:** Monday, September 12
**Presentations:** Wednesday, September 14


## Part 2 - Individuals

From there, you will work alone to produce a project using the subject domain research as its basis. To guide your project, write a research statement for the project:

> I am creating _________  
> because I want to find out who/why/how __________  
> in order to understand how/why/what ___________


**Due:** Monday, September 19


Prepare a 5 minute presentation of your individual project, including a discussion of how it addresses the above research statement.

**Presentations:** Monday, September 19 + Wednesday, September 21
