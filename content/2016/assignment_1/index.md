# Assignment 1 - 7 in 7 Project

In today's class each of you will develop a method or constraint to guide the conceptualization of a daily project.

### For the next seven days, create one project a day.

**Rule 1:** Each project must be conceptualized, produced and documented in a single day.

**Rule 2:** Each project must follow the constraint you develop in class.

**These are the only rules of the project, and should not be bent or broken.**

### Thoughts
- The projects may be all in the same medium, or utilize different media.
- The more experimental in nature, the better.
- There is no “wrong” way to do this project (other than break the two rules).


### Guiding Questions:
- When is a project fully complete? How do you know you are “finished” with a project?
- How does the framing of a project, its context, scope, and parameters, determine the
content created? What is the relationship between concept and execution?
- Upon reflection is there anything that ties your projects together? Can you see an
emergent theme in your work?
- After completing your projects what do you think could have been improved? If you were
to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?


### Deliverables:
- Document your projects each day and blog about the conceptualization, development and outcome of each. Add links to your posts in your channel on Slack. **Pin your links.**
- Each day review the work of your classmates and comment on each other's work on Slack.
- At the end of the project make a post of your reflections on the experience as a whole.
