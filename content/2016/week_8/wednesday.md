## Proposal Outline Workshop

### Design Question

`20 minutes`

  - Begin with one of the Design Questions that emerged from the Domains workshop or your research.
  - List 3 important domains related to your question.
  - For each domain write an (overly) broad Design Question.
  - Write 3 very (overly) narrow Design Questions.
  - Discuss these questions with your partner and select the most interesting and useful broad Design Question and narrow Design Question.
  - Write a Design Question with a scope between your original and broad Questions.
  - Write another with a scope between your original and narrow questions.

  You should now have 5 questions with a range of scopes.

  `Broad -> Middle Broad -> Original > Middle Narrow -> Narrow`

  Review these questions with your partner. Choose two of these questions as your core Design Questions.  

### Domains
`10 minutes`

  List 2 or 3 of domains in which your Design Questions sit. Choose domains that are somewhat specific. For each domain answer:

  - How does this domain relate to your Design Questions?
  - Why is this domain interesting to you?
  - What is your experience or relationship with the domain?

  Discuss with your partner, revise.

### Precedents
`15 minutes`

  Choose 3-5 of your identified precedents that best relate to your area of inquiry. For each precedent answer:
  - How does this precedent relate to your Design Question?
  - What can you learn from it?
