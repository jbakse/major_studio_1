# Final Presentation

- Our final critiques will be held on D12.
- Each crit will be about 20 minutes long.  
- Please have your work on display in the classroom before the crits begin.
- Each crit should begin with a 5 minute semi-formal presentation, covering the info below.
- Presentations may be digital decks or printed pin-ups.


#### Context
Introduce us to your project. What are you exploring? Why is it important? Why were you motivated to explore your design question? Briefly discuss some of the background research you did.

#### Precedents
Discuss some of the existing work in your field of inquiry. Tell us about some of the key differences between these precedents and your own work.

#### Project
Demonstrate your project for us. Tell us how it is responding to your design question.

#### Documentation
Depending on your project, demonstrating your project live may be impossible, difficult, or insufficient. Please carefully consider how using photographs and video might help us understand your project better during crit, and support your presentation with additional media if appropriate. If you want to show video of people interacting with your project, please limit video length to a 1-3 minutes (additional to your presentation).

**Photo and video documentation is a required final deliverable for the class.**

#### Impact
How does your project achieve your goal? What impact will your project have, why is it important? Is there any future iteration/consideration you wish to discuss?
