## You are Here
`4:10`

So far you have:
- identified an area of inquiry and located it within domains.
- found precedents to inform your process.
- decided on a target audience and desired impact.
- found a lens to approach the project through.
- settled on a final guiding design question.
- proposed an initial concept and direction.

**Your guiding questions should be considered locked now.**

**Do not change horses midstream.**

This question should anchor and guide your process from here forward.  It can be tempting to scrap an idea when you are facing difficulties and see another idea you believe will work better. Often the other idea isn't as easy at it seems, and you always loose time and insights in the process.

Next you will:
- explore your proposed concept
- identify the core design questions surrounding your concept
- test these questions through prototyping (and other methods)

In a couple of weeks you will:
- converge on a final concept

## What is a Prototype
`4:25`

Studies, Sketches, Drafts, Surveys, Storyboards, Wireframes, Mockups, Renderings, User Stories, Treatments

### Prototypes

Houde and Hill define prototypes as
> ...any representation of a design idea, regardless of medium.  
> This includes a preexisting object when used to answer a design question.

I think of prototypes this way:
> Prototyping is one of the tools designers use to test ideas.  
> A prototype tests one or more characteristics of a possible design.  
> A prototype embodies the characteristics being tested.



## What to Prototype
`4:45`
You should use prototypes to explore and test important aspects of your project. Focus on the most important and least clear aspects. Important aspects should be tested even if you think you know the best way to address them.

The first step in creating a prototype is identifying your projects important open design questions. Consider your project and its purpose, focus on important areas, and list questions that need to be answered.

This formula may help articulate the purpose for your prototypes:

> I am in the early stages of designing ______________.   
> A core consideration for this project is _____________________.  
> Specifically, I want to find out __________________.  


I am in the early stages of designing **software to visualize room layouts**.
A core consideration for this project is **how users will position furniture in the visualizer**.
Specifically I want to find out **what types of manipulations users need to make**.


I am in the early stages of designing **a workshop to teach html/css**.
A core consideration for this project is **what kind in-class assignment to use**.
Specifically I want to find out **if having students re-create a poster in html/css will be effective**.


I am in the early stages of designing **a device for scientists to use in their field work**.
A core consideration for this project is **portability**.
Specifically, I want to find out **if a scientist working alone can easily transport the device from their lab to the field**.



## Assignment
`5:05`

**Due Wednesday**

You will begin to build, test and document a prototype in class today. Letting your open design questions guide you, create 1 - 3 **additional** prototype as homework. Some projects may suggest a few quick prototypes, others might be better informed by creating a single more developed prototype. Either way don't spend more than 3 hours outside class on creating and documenting these. These initial prototypes are meant to be quick, low-fidelity prototypes.


- Build 2 - 4 Prototypes
- Test your prototypes
- Document your test with "phoneboards"
- Write up a blog post documenting your prototypes

In your blog post include:
- A written overview for each prototype including what your prototype tests, a description of the prototype itself, and your findings. Consider using the formula above to introduce each prototype.
- An image showing your prototype.
- A "phoneboard" showing your prototype being tested.



## In-class Prototyping Time
- Using the provided formula list 5 open design questions. Aim for a variety of concerns.
- Consider how you might create a quick, low-fidelity prototype to help answer each question.
- Build a prototype, test it, and document it.
