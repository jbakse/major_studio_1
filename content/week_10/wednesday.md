## Design Values
*4:20-5:00*

Read John Sharp’s essay on design values and consider the “qualities and characteristics you want to embody in your work.”

Following the example in John’s essay, develop a set of five design values. Write a title (1-6 words) and description (50-100 words) for each value.

Complete this exercise as homework.

## Editing Workshop
*5:00-6:30*

Pair up on google docs, read each other's papers, make notes, and discuss.

If you have time, repeat with other partners.

### Read It

**First, read the text for general meaning**

Read for broad meaning. Do not mark corrections or note errors.

After each paragraph, write a small note about what the main subject or point of the paragraph. If the point is unclear, note that instead. If a sentence in the paragraph expresses that point clearly, underline it. 


### Read it Again

**Second, look for problems with the content.**

- Is the overall all message clear? 
- Are the [required elements](../assignment_final/) present?
- Are all ideas clearly connected?
- Are claims well supported?
- Are there examples and quotes relevant?
- Do you think something is missing?
- Do you think something is unnecessary?
- Do you think something should be reordered?


Make notes when find yourself asking "what does this mean?" or "why is this included?
".

If grammar is making the sentence indecipherable, make note of it now. It may be a content issue as well.




### Mark Grammar, Punctuation, and Spelling 

**Thirds, maybe, mark grammar, punctuation, and spelling.**

Generally, it is better to wait until a second draft before marking grammar, punctuation, and spelling. But quick or important changes can be noted here as well.

In later drafts where the overall content is laid out well and well supported, you will focus on this type of feedback.
