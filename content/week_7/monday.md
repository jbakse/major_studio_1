## Design Question & Core Attributes Workshop
`5:30`

A design question, artistic investigation or core uncertainty is something that can describe a research domain and motivate creative practice.

In this workshop,

Please consider:
- What kinds of explorations motivate your creative practice?
- What conceptual, aesthetic, and technical questions drive this project as a whole?
- What are the core uncertainties of your investigation?
- Are there key qualities, aspects or factors that you would like to describe your project or define its boundaries ? (examples: modularity, open ended construction, multiple solution form factor, participatory, alternative sensory, human computer interface etc).

Reflecting on the above issues:
- Create one list of questions / investigations.
- Create another list of qualities / values.
- Group the design questions as you see fit: in terms of concept, aesthetics, audience participation and technical means of creation
- Rank your questions in order of importance within their groups.


Working with a partner, suggest any new questions to both of your lists as needed. Question everything, particularly things you think you already know (rather than make assumptions).  Make sure to consider:
- Who? (co-designers, collaborators, users, participants, audience)
- Where?
- When?
- Why? (are you making this, why now, why for these people)
- Why you? (what is your unique POV, contribution, access etc)



Core attributes:
- What are key qualities, aesthetics, attributes or adjectives you would like to be associated with the work?
- What are the tensions, contradictions, gaps, surprises; or the unusual juxtapositions, ironies or patterns youâ€™ve encountered in your research and making?
- What kind of experience do you want people to have who engage with this work?
- Ultimately, what problem are you trying to solve (if design-oriented)? What are you trying express, convey, explore or facilitate (if art-focused)?

Synthesize, write up any unexpected findings, post to the class blog. -->
