# Week 1 Monday

I didn't send out the pre-semester email. Actually I did send it, but just to myself and my RA, not to the students.

Because of this students did not have a 2 minute intro presentation. I substituted a quick interview and peer introduction workshop. This went fine.

The Computer lectures went well. Students seemed interested and engaged. Lecture took about 30 minutes as planned.

Class introduction and syllabus review took longer than planned, about 45-50 minutes instead of 30 minutes. This is mostly due to questions from students and discussion.

The Studio Introduction workshop had to be run quicker than planned. We had about 40 minutes instead of an hour. I shortened each round a bit, and the discussion was a little shorter than planned. Overall, the workshop felt fast paced but not rushed.
