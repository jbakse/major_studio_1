### Thoughts
- The projects may be all in the same medium, or utilize different media.
- The more experimental in nature, the better.
- There is no “wrong” way to do this project (other than break the two rules).


### Guiding Questions:
- When is a project fully complete? How do you know you are “finished” with a project?
- How does the framing of a project, its context, scope, and parameters, determine the
content created? What is the relationship between concept and execution?
- Upon reflection is there anything that ties your projects together? Can you see an
emergent theme in your work?
- After completing your projects what do you think could have been improved? If you were
to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?






Framing
    What is important?
    What are the goals?
    What is success?


What is a constraint?
Where do constraints come from?

[Dogme 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95)
1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).
2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.)
3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.
4. The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).
5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.
6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)
7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now).
8. Genre movies are not acceptable.
9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.
10. The director must not be credited.

How can constraints lead to success? What is success?
