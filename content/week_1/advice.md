# Advice for Art Students

### Art is demanding area of study. It demands much of your time, of your energy, of your thought, and of your self. If you are going to be spending all that time and energy, you might as well spend it wisely. Most of this advice requires very little or no extra time and effort and is fairly easy to follow, once you start.

## Make Friends with Strangers
The stranger, the better. It is easier to make friends with people you have a lot in common with: people from the same academic background, from the same hometown or country. Its harder to make friends with strangers, but you can learn so much just spending time with them.

## Critique is Critical
There is no reason to come to school just to make art on your own. Talking about your work and the work of others with a community of other artists is immensely valuable to your personal development. Speak up and listen critically in every critique, not just your own.

## Take Advantage of your School
You school has a great variety of resources from faculty to equipment. Try to talk to everyone and use everything at least once. Work this into your projects as you go.

## Own your Projects
Don't let your assignments own your projects. Assignments are starting points, not checklists.

Don't let your resume own your projects. Don't worry about how a project will help you land a job. You are better of following your interests even if they take you to weird places.

## Front-load Your Projects
Seriously. Everyone gets this wrong, at least at first. Last-minute all-nighters are ubiquitous in art school culture. Go ahead, pull your all-nighters if that works for you, but pull them at the beginning of the project, not the end. Getting ahead of your work gives you **time**. Time to find help, time to order supplies, time to get the right tool, time to realize when something isn't working and fix it.

## Document Carefully + Constantly
Learn how to use a camera well. Make a habit of taking pictures of your work every day. Write about your work every couple of days, just for yourself. Find a way to organize this work. Publish something every week. Set things up so that this is easy to do.

## Get an Editor for Everything
As a rule of thumb you should have someone read over everything you write that will be seen by more than one other person. I should have an editor look at this, for example. Run early drafts and final drafts by someone else. It is very difficult to edit your own work, because you already know what you mean.

## Put Your Work in a Frame
The way you present your work has a major impact on how people perceive it. An untrimmed poster that keeps rolling up on the table feels like a draft and demands less respect than a carefully centered and cut poster hanging flat on the wall. This applies to just about everything.

## Live in the Studio
The studio is the physical center of your academic community. If you have the choice of working at home or working in the studio, work in the studio. Make the studio your home-base and head there before and after classes. These habits will keep you better connected with other students.
