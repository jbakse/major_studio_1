[Brian Eno, "Ambient 1/Music for Airports - 2/1"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R-mscnjI14)

>Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable -- they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system.

— Brian Eno, Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996

## Warm Up
*3:50—4:05*


In *exactly* 10 words.

- What is your definition of Design?
- Is Design a method of general expression?
- Does Design imply the idea of products that are necessarily useful?
- Can the computer substitute for the Designer?

## Design Q & A + Charles and Ray Eames
*4:05—4:20*

### Who Charles and Ray Are

> Charles Ormond Eames, Jr (1907–1978) and Bernice Alexandra "Ray" Eames (1912–1988) were husband and wife American designers who made significant historical contributions to the development of modern architecture and furniture.

## Self-imposed Constraints
*4:20—4:40*

Self-imposed constraints force creative solutions.

- Comment on in the "thread thread" on slack/offical?
- Launch your website?
- Post your Studio Introduction link, name, and photo to slack?
- Post your link to the [Assignment Matrix](https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/spreadsheets/d/1PUGHF2wfe7VnJfYr5eYh9nNO6ekzHLHUrzS6PIz_WQ4/edit?usp=sharing)?

## Break
*4:40-4:50*

## 7-in-7
*4:50-5:10*
Introduction and discussion of [7-in-7 assignment](../assignment_7_in_7).

## Constraints + Framing Workshop
*5:10-6:30*

### Instructor
Divide the class into pairs.

### Qualities of Productive Constraints
*Class, 10 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm qualities of productive constraints.

For example: *Encourages Variety*


### Attributes of Artwork
*Class, 10 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm attributes of artworks. These are things you might mention when describing an artwork to someone.

For example: *Size*

### Sources of Urgency
*Class, 10 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm sources of urgency or chance. These should be easily accessible, but unpredictable outside forces.

For example: *Newspaper Headlines*

### Draft, Round 1
*Individual, 5 minutes*

Write 2 constraints, these **are not** the constraints that you will use for 7-in-7.

Each constraint should relate to two items from different lists generated in the previous steps.

### Swap
*Groups, 5 minutes*

Read and explain your constraints to your partner. Edit your constraint if it is unclear. Trade your first constraint with your partners first constraint.

### Share
*Class, 10 minutes*

Read your pair of constraints to the class.

### Draft, Round 2
*Individual, 10 minutes*

Write 2-3 constraints, these **will be** the constraints that you will use for 7-in-7.

### Edit
*Groups, 10 minutes*

Partners review and edit their constraints.

### Share
*Class, 10 minutes*

Read your final constraints to the class.
