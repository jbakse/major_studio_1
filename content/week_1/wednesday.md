Brian Eno - [Ambient 1/Music for Airports - 2/1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R-mscnjI14)

>Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable -- they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system.

— Brian Eno, Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996


## Quick Assignment and Technology Review
`3:50`
- Did everyone get their site up and first project posted?
- Did everyone get set up on Slack?
- What went wrong, what went right?
- Do you have any suggestions about how to use Slack?



## Community of Practice Mapping Workshop
`4:00`
Intro + Team up

Work in teams to map out the collective relationships between your group, other MFADT students and faculty, and a research interest determined by teams. Document the iterations the map goes through, considering how the final mapping would need to be presented in order to retain coherence.

The form of your map is up to to you and your team. Don't look to other teams to see if you are doing it right, *assume they are doing it wrong*.

Take pictures and notes throughout this workshop documenting the process and each version of your map, and your thoughts on it. You will need these pictures later.


`4:10`
Round 1: Team

Create a mapping of each individual as well as the connections between individuals within the group. It is okay to include personal information, but pay special attention to areas of inquiry and topics of interest for each person.

`4:20`
Round 2: + Class, AMT Faculty, Parsons Resources

Extend this map to include your classmates, the MFADT faculty, and New School resources. This will require some research on the part of your group. What do you know, and what do you not yet know? How would you go about acquiring the information you need? Incorporate these flows into the map.

`4:40`
Round 3: + team research interest

Work as a team to choose a topic to incorporate into your map. Do not spend more than 5 minutes choosing this topic. Work together to research your topic and incorporate your findings into your map.

> Here is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. Constraints of price, of size, of strength, of balance, of surface, of time, and so forth. Each problem has its own peculiar list.

Transcript: http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/design-q-a-text/

- Do you disagree with any of Charles's answers? Why?
- Do any of these questions or answers resonate with you as particularly important or interesting?
- These questions try to establish the "boundaries of design", how does an understanding of what design is impact the practice of design?
- What constraints would you suggest apply to all design projects?

### Design Constraints Workshop
`6:00`

- Create a process that yields a prompt or constraint that you will use for your daily project.
- Eliminate choices: your process should force you into a particular daily constraint.
- Ensure that your process can be completed every day of the week. Don't rely on anything that only happens on weekdays.
- Don't change your process. Once set, stick with your process for the week.
- Post your process to your Slack channel at the end of class today, 6:30pm.

#### Examples
- Given two decks [writing, drawing, 2D print, laser-cut, 3D print, web, video] and [salesperson, cashier, clerk, cook, nurse, waiter, janitor]. Each day shuffle both decks take the top card from each and use these two as your prompt. Discard the used card.
- Each day determine the least prominent story on the front page of the first newspaper you can find. Phrase the headline as a yes/no question. Create an artwork as an affirmative answer to that question.

`10min` in two groups: brainstorm ideas

`15min` in pairs: create detailed process, and write it clearly and concisely

`5min` announce idea
