### Community of Practice Mapping Workshop
`4:10`
Intro + Team up

Work in teams to map out the collective relationships between your group, other MFADT students and faculty, and a research interest determined by teams. Document the iterations the map goes through, considering how the final mapping would need to be presented in order to retain coherence.

The form of your map is up to to you and your team. Don't look to other teams to see if you are doing it right, *assume they are doing it wrong*.

Take pictures and notes throughout this workshop documenting the process and each version of your map, and your thoughts on it. You will need these pictures later.


`4:20`
Round 1: Team

Create a mapping of each individual as well as the connections between individuals within the group. It is okay to include personal information, but pay special attention to areas of inquiry and topics of interest for each person.

`4:35`
Round 2: + Class, AMT Faculty, Parsons Resources

Extend this map to include your classmates, the MFADT faculty, and New School resources. This will require some research on the part of your group. What do you know, and what do you not yet know? How would you go about acquiring the information you need? Incorporate these flows into the map.

`5:00`
Round 3: + team research interest

Work as a team to choose a topic to incorporate into your map. Do not spend more than 5 minutes choosing this topic. Work together to research your topic and incorporate your findings into your map.
