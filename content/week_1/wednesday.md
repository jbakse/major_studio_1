[Brian Eno, "Ambient 1/Music for Airports - 2/1"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R-mscnjI14)

>Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable -- they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system.

— Brian Eno, Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996

## Break
*4:40-4:50*

## 7-in-7
*4:50-5:10*


## Constraints Workshop
*5:10-6:30*

### Instructor
Divide the class into pairs.

### Qualities of Productive Constraints
*10 minutes*

As a class brainstorm qualities of productive constraints. For example: *Encourages Variety*


### Qualities of Artwork
*10 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm qualities of artworks. For example: *Size*

### Sources of Urgency
*10 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm sources of urgency or chance. These should be easily accessible, but unpredictable outside forces. For example: *Newspaper Headlines*

### Draft, Round 1
*5 minutes*
Write 2 constraints, these **are not** the constraints that you will use for 7-in-7. Each constraint should relate to an quality on the "Productive Constraints" list and a quality on the "Artwork" list.

### Swap
*5 minutes*
Read and explain your constraints to your partner. Edit your constraint if it is unclear. Trade your first constraint with your partners first constraint.

### Share
*10 minutes*
Read your pair of constraints to the class.

### Draft, Round 2
*10 minutes*
Write 2-3 constraints, these **will be** the constraints that you will use for 7-in-7.

### Edit
*10 minutes*
Partners review and edit their constraints.

### Share
*10 minutes*
Read your final constraints to the class.













### Thoughts
- The projects may be all in the same medium, or utilize different media.
- The more experimental in nature, the better.
- There is no “wrong” way to do this project (other than break the two rules).


### Guiding Questions:
- When is a project fully complete? How do you know you are “finished” with a project?
- How does the framing of a project, its context, scope, and parameters, determine the
content created? What is the relationship between concept and execution?
- Upon reflection is there anything that ties your projects together? Can you see an
emergent theme in your work?
- After completing your projects what do you think could have been improved? If you were
to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?






Framing
    What is important?
    What are the goals?
    What is success?


What is a constraint?
Where do constraints come from?

Oblique Strategies - Brian Eno


[Dogme 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95)
1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).
2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.)
3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.
4. The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).
5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.
6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)
7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now).
8. Genre movies are not acceptable.
9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.
10. The director must not be credited.
