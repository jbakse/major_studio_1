# Assignment 0 - Introduction

## To help us all get to know one another, I'll be setting aside 5 minutes for each of you to introduce yourself. 

<br/>

### You should communicate the following:

- Who are you?
- What is your background?
- What are you here to do?
- Why do you want to do that?
- How are you going to meet your goals for the next two years?

### Focus on making your introduction:

- Clear
- Complete
- Memorable

### Constraints:

- You may not use more than 5 minutes, but you may use less.
- You may speak, but you are not required to.
- You should use at least one media that is not speach.
- You can use anything in the room, and you may bring anything else you need.
- You should be prepared to present your introduction on the first day of class.

### Thoughts:

- Consider this to be your first project. Put some time in before class to prepare.
- We will vote as a class on which introduction is: clearest, most memerable, funniest, friendliest, most beautiful, most entertainting, least predictable, most efficient, best conceived, best executed.
