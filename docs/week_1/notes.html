		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li>The projects may be all in the same medium, or utilize different media.</li>
<li>The more experimental in nature, the better.</li>
<li>There is no “wrong” way to do this project (other than break the two rules).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guiding Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When is a project fully complete? How do you know you are “finished” with a project?</li>
<li>How does the framing of a project, its context, scope, and parameters, determine the
content created? What is the relationship between concept and execution?</li>
<li>Upon reflection is there anything that ties your projects together? Can you see an
emergent theme in your work?</li>
<li>After completing your projects what do you think could have been improved? If you were
to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?</li>
</ul>
<p>Framing
What is important?
What are the goals?
What is success?</p>
<p>What is a constraint?
Where do constraints come from?</p>

<li>Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).</li>
<li>The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.)</li>
<li>The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.</li>
<li>The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).</li>
<li>Optical work and filters are forbidden.</li>
<li>The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)</li>
<li>Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now).</li>
<li>Genre movies are not acceptable.</li>
<li>The film format must be Academy 35 mm.</li>
<li>The director must not be credited.</li>
