		<h1>Week 1 Monday</h1>
<p>I didn’t send out the pre-semester email. Actually I did send it, but just to myself and my RA, not to the students.</p>
<p>Because of this students did not have a 2 minute intro presentation. I substituted a quick interview and peer introduction workshop. This went fine.</p>
<p>The Computer lectures went well. Students seemed interested and engaged. Lecture took about 30 minutes as planned.</p>
<p>Class introduction and syllabus review took longer than planned, about 45-50 minutes instead of 30 minutes. This is mostly due to questions from students and discussion.</p>
<p>The Studio Introduction workshop had to be run quicker than planned. We had about 40 minutes instead of an hour. I shortened each round a bit, and the discussion was a little shorter than planned. Overall, the workshop felt fast paced but not rushed.</p>
<h1>Week 1 Wednesday</h1>
<p>Didn’t get to class early to play the preamble music videos.</p>
<p>Warmup with having students answer Design Q&amp;A questions before showing Design Q&amp;A went well.</p>
<p>Wish I had a little more time to go through the examples, had to rush to keep time for the constraints workshop.</p>
<p>Constraints workshop went well, introduced many design verbs, including brainstorming, dividing, connecting.</p>
<p>Students didn’t have final constraints, but were on their way.</p>
