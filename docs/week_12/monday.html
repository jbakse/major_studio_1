		<h1>Week 12 — Monday</h1>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p><em>3:30—3:50</em></p>
<h2>User Testing</h2>
<p><em>3:50-4:40</em></p>
<p>The number one thing to remember about user testing, is just to do it. Just about any form of user testing can be helpful for learning about how other will interface with your projects.</p>
<p>The specifics of how to user test will vary based on the specifics of what you need to learn, but consider the following.</p>
<h3>How Many?</h3>
<p>When user testing, you want to observe more than one person using your project. This makes it possible to identify trends. On the other hand, testing is time consuming and you’ll face diminishing returns as you test with more and more people. Five testers is often enough, especially early on.</p>
<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>You should test with users that you are targeting as your audience.</p>
<h3>Watch and Listen</h3>
<p>Don’t trust your test users. Often, what they say and what they actually do are different. Don’t ignore them either. You want to know more than just what they do, you want to know why they do it and how they feel about it.</p>
<h3>What to Show Them</h3>
<p>Consider what you show your test users, and how you prepare them. Do you want them coming in blind or fully briefed? Are you testing something specific, or just watching to see what happens?</p>
