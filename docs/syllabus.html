<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>The goal of Major Studio 1 is to introduce students to the design process, research methods and studio critique environment. The course is a space for critical thinking and discussion about evolving issues in the fields of design and technology. The course is not a technical class, but rather dedicated to exploring the development of concept and process for which innovative use of tools and media will be applied.</p>
<p>The course is run in a studio format, with the primary focus being the creation of self-directed work. Students will work individually and in groups to produce both theoretical and applied projects. In addition to making, all students are also required to contribute to discussion and critique as a substantial part of their grade to demonstrate their understanding and perspective on the subjects studied. Readings, research and writing assignments will complement design projects. Thematics to be introduced include: community of practice; design constraints and rules; speculation and hypothesis; public engagement; design context and impact.</p>
<p>Major Studio 1 is the first in a series of four MFADT Studio courses: Major Studio 1, Major Studio 2, Thesis Studio 1 and Thesis Studio 2. These four courses are the core of the curriculum, with technical and academic electives supporting the central studio. Major Studios focus on development of concept and method; while support electives concentrate on technical development. Students are responsible for establishing intersections across different classes in their course of study.</p>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the successful completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the relationship between concept, form, and domain.</li>
<li>Practice ideation techniques that explore multiple approaches to making ideas material.</li>
<li>Explore process for taking project concepts through successive stages of conceptualization, prototyping, testing and evaluation.</li>
<li>Demonstrate competency with use of iterative prototyping in their project based work.</li>
<li>Demonstrate competency with research strategies in the presentation and documentation of creative practice.</li>
<li>Demonstrate competency with analytical thinking to test and critically evaluate concepts, as evidenced by articulating a competent defense of their own work, and offering constructive criticism of others.</li>
<li>Demonstrate competency describing the context of their work; how their work relates to history, ideas, and other creative works in the fields of art, design and technology.</li>
<li>Work productively in small team and collaborative contexts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Components</h2>
<h3>Four Primary Assignments</h3>
<p>The course has four primary assignments exploring design and technology within a physical, social, and cultural framework. Projects will be created both individually and in groups at the discretion of the faculty.</p>
<ul>
<li>7 in 7</li>
<li>Ideas in Form</li>
<li>Instruction Sets for Strangers</li>
<li>Final individual project</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critique, Presentation and Discussion</h3>
<p>The presentation and discussion of work is an integral component of the course. Students are expected to present their work in a clear and concise manner during both casual and more formalized critique sessions, which may include invited guest critics. Students should also be prepared to ask questions and provide constructive criticism to their fellow students.</p>
<h3>Presentation Guidelines</h3>
<p>When presenting, students should explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context: what is your area of inquiry? What are you studying, experimenting with, questioning; and why?</li>
<li>Intention: what do you plan to make, and why? How is this making a response to your inquiry?</li>
<li>Impact: what is the goal of your project, what impact do you think it will have, why is it important?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing and Research</h3>
<p>The ability to formulate and present a strong argument is essential to all creative work. Students will do a variety of writing, which may include automatic writing, reflection documents, blog posts, design briefs, and user scenarios.</p>
<h3>Reading and Discussion</h3>
<p>Personal Responses: Students will post a short paragraph (~ 300 words) to their blog/website in response to assigned readings before each discussion class.</p>
<p>Reading Moderation: Students will sign up in groups of 2 - 3 to moderate discussion for at least one reading per semester. The goal of these discussions is not to summarize the reading, but rather to voice an opinion on how the text relates to areas of personal interest, current projects, and current events.</p>
<p>Moderators will post a more in depth reading commentary (~ 600 words) before their given class that ends with questions for discussion. Presentations should focus on interaction and involve rest of the class with conversation or activities. Short exercises, games or visual presentations are encouraged.</p>

<h2>Personal Site, Class Slack, and Deliverables</h2>
<h3>Personal Site</h3>
<p>Students will post all course work, including reading responses, writing assignments, project prototypes, work in progress and final documentation, and final projects to their own website. Students may host their own site however they choose. Creating, maintaining and hosting web site is the students responsibility and students are encouraged to choose a hosting solution that matches their existing skill level creating websites. Some possibilities include basic shared hosting, AWS, Github pages, Tumblr, and Wordpress. Students are free to add course work to their existing personal site or create a separate site for the course.</p>
<h3>Class Slack</h3>
<p>This class will use a <a href="https://ms1-d.slack.com">Slack team</a> to organize class communication in several ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Official Channel: This channel will class information, announcements, and resources. The instructor will be the primary poster in this channel, but students and groups leading in class discussion or workshops may also post here. You may also post questions here that are relevant to the whole class. You will be expected to follow this channel closely.</li>
<li>Chatter Channel: This channel will be used for public real-time chat outside of classroom hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Paper</h3>
<p>Students will write a 1500 - 2500 word (3-5 page) paper, to outline the research and defend the concept of their final projects.</p>
<p>Students will be required make an appointment with the writing center after writing their rough draft to get feedback on the development of their argument and assistance with citing their sources.</p>
<h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
<p>At the end of each project, you will turn in your project files and documentation as a single zipped document to a class folder on Google Drive. You should name your document following this template: <code>ms1-fall16-[lastName]-[assignmentName].zip</code></p>

<h2>Major Assignments</h2>
<h3>Design Constraints: 7 in 7</h3>
<p>Define a set of rules or constraints that will guide your creative process for the following week. Execute a creative project every day for seven days based on these constraints.</p>
<h3>Ideas in Form</h3>
<p>Research an area of inquiry. Create a series of projects that investigate different aspects of that inquiry.</p>
<h3>Public Engagement: Instruction Sets for Strangers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyze: Choose a space you find interesting. Research its history &amp; architecture. Observe flows &amp; patterns for 24 hours. Document &amp; map. Propose 3 potential interventions.</li>
<li>Define: Design an intervention you think would facilitate meaningful interaction and be specific to that site. Research &amp; define it. Consider the ideas of invitation (how to get people involved) and triangulation (how to get people to interact with one another).</li>
<li>Prototype and test: Put the prototype into the space and document the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Project</h3>
<p>Students work individually to formulate a creative premise or question, methodology and project based response. Students are encouraged to think about their own personal design process: what ideas interest them, how they research them, how they develop a personal premise (opinion) about them, and how they produce a creative work in response to their query.</p>
<h3>Final Paper</h3>
<p>The paper should defend the project-based work that students created in response to their design questions. The paper should explain the project’s conceptual background &amp; methodology by forming a clear argument based on a concise presentation of research. The paper is not simply a summary of your project, or a research compilation, it must be structured as an argument that uses research to prove the point students are seeking to make with their work.</p>

<p>Students in the course will receive feedback on the following areas:</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>How well is the student able to express their ideas, both verbally and with other forms of communication such as: writing, drawing, mapping, modeling, pre-visualizing etc?</p>
<h3>Critical Thinking and Reflective Judgment</h3>
<p>To what degree has the student demonstrated and developed critical thinking skills over the course of the semester? Reflective judgment not only asks the questions with concrete answers such as evaluative questions about form, methodology, materials, utility, ergonomics, aesthetics, style, cultural, experience, research, and process critique, but also attacks difficult problems of the world that require research and evidence to support conclusions that can then be offered to the fields encompassed by design and technology.</p>
<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>How is the student incorporating proper use of problem identification, brainstorming, generating ideas, analysis, research, writing of specifications and constraints, real world costs, feasibility, testing, iterating along a line of thinking and then approaching the problem differently in the next cycle, evaluation of process and evaluation of the form created, integrating and adapting new processes and ideas along the iterative design cycle.</p>
<h3>Contextualization, Conclusion and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Have the students been able to connect their work and ideas to historical and contemporary precedents, and to situate their work within the larger discourse surrounding ideas of design and technology? Can the student confidently synthesize several different approaches to a design problem and make conclusions of their own? Can the student evaluate their projectsʼ successes and failures?</p>
<h3>Integration and Appropriate Use of Technology</h3>
<p>Are the students making good choices about the form and type of technology they are using to express their design concepts? Are the students able to integrate technology into the conceptualization of their projects?</p>
<h3>Iteration, Production, Time Management</h3>
<p>Are students able to scale their projects to the appropriate time frame and technical/design resources at their disposal? Are students recording their thoughts and processes on their website so that their knowledge can be shared with the rest of the class.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Grade of D</h3>
<p>Grades of D are not used in graduate level courses.</p>
<h3>Grade of W</h3>
<p>The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete.</p>
<h3>Grade of Z</h3>
<p>The grade of Z is issued by an instructor to a student who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade.</p>
<h3>Grades of Incomplete</h3>
<p>The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations: work must be completed no later than one year following the end of the class. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “N” by the Registrar’s Office.</p>
<h2>Divisional, Program and Class Policies</h2>
<h3>Responsibility</h3>
<p>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.  Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.</p>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.</p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Parsons’s attendance guidelines were developed to encourage student success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.</p>
<p>While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</p>
<p><strong>To Be Clear</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you miss 3 classes your grade will most likely be reduced.</li>
<li>If you miss 6 classes you will most likely be asked to withdraw from class.</li>
<li>This is true even if you complete all assignments and class work on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the course is a lecture, seminar or studio, faculty will assess each student’s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining the student’s final grade.</p>
<h3>Slack</h3>
<p>Slack is an important resource for this class. Students should check it at least daily for announcements.</p>
<h3>Delays</h3>
<p>In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class.  If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival.  In the event that I will miss class entirely, a message will be posted on Slack and sent by email indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.</p>
<h3>Electronic Devices</h3>
<p>The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course’s work and only when indicated by the instructor. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.</p>
<h3>Academic Honesty and Integrity</h3>
<p>The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others.  Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.</p>
<p><strong>To Be Clear</strong></p>
<p>All work you present or turn in for this class should be created solely by you, or <strong>clearly</strong> cited. This is true of in both group and solo projects. This includes quotes, images, and code.</p>
<h3>Student Disability Services (SDS)</h3>
<p>In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately.  All conversations will be kept confidential.  Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me.  SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/">http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/</a>.</p>
