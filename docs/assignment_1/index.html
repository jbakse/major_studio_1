		<h1>Assignment 1 - 7 in 7 Project</h1>
<p>In today’s class each of you will develop a method or constraint to guide the conceptualization of a daily project.</p>
<h3>For the next seven days, create one project a day.</h3>
<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> Each project must be conceptualized, produced and documented in a single day.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Each project must follow the constraint you develop in class.</p>
<p><strong>These are the only rules of the project, and should not be bent or broken.</strong></p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li>The projects may be all in the same medium, or utilize different media.</li>
<li>The more experimental in nature, the better.</li>
<li>There is no “wrong” way to do this project (other than break the two rules).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guiding Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When is a project fully complete? How do you know you are “finished” with a project?</li>
<li>How does the framing of a project, its context, scope, and parameters, determine the
content created? What is the relationship between concept and execution?</li>
<li>Upon reflection is there anything that ties your projects together? Can you see an
emergent theme in your work?</li>
<li>After completing your projects what do you think could have been improved? If you were
to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Document your projects each day and blog about the conceptualization, development and outcome of each. Add links to your posts in your channel on Slack. <strong>Pin your links.</strong></li>
<li>Each day review the work of your classmates and comment on each other’s work on Slack.</li>
<li>At the end of the project make a post of your reflections on the experience as a whole.</li>
</ul>
