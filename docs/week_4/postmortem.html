		<h1>Week 4 Monday</h1>
<p>Class went well. Timings worked as expected.</p>
<p>Class growing more comfortable with critique. The open crit portion went well.</p>
<p>Had one student follow up with me very confused about the studies.</p>
<p>She was asking why we didn’t just do more book research, claimed she wasn’t learning from making. We talked a long while, it seemed to make things more confused at first. I think for her the issue stemmed from me saying these “studies” were not &quot;prototypes&quot;. She came from a design background, and understood the value of prototyping, but thought of them broadly. By excluding her broad understanding of prototypes, she couldn’t figure out what I wanted. This was partly compounded by her being an english language learner.</p>
<h1>Week 4 Wednesday</h1>
<p>No Class</p>
