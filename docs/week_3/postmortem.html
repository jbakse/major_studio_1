		<h1>Week 2 Monday</h1>
<p>This day was almost entirely presentations
Even with two students and their presentations out, we ran long. Class went over by 30 minutes, while still feeling rushed.</p>
<p>The rubric feedback worked well, I think. It didn’t always fit the issues in the presenation very well, sometimes did.</p>
<p>Having a panel assigned for each review to start off the conversation worked well.</p>
<p>It worked better at the beginning, people got tired from concentrating and the repetition by the end. Conversation towards the end felt more rushed and duller.</p>
<p>I don’t want to break up the presentation, but it might be necessary with 15 students.</p>
<p>Another option would be to not give individual feedback, but we need time for that as well.</p>
