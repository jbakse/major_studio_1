		<h1>Assignment 4A — Final Project</h1>
<p>The second half of the semester is dedicated to the Final Project and the related <a href="../assignment_paper">Final Paper</a>.</p>
<h3>Final Project</h3>
<p>For your final, you will conceptualize, prototype, design, develop and document a self-directed project. The nature of this project is up to you, and should reflect your personal design interests and values.</p>
<p>You will document your process and post to your personal portfolio blog throughout this project, including summaries of your research, creative decisions, questions posed by your prototypes, outcomes and responses from testing, and production decisions. This material will due along with the final form of your project.</p>
<p><strong>You must post significant process updates each week.</strong></p>
<p>The content of these posts will vary from student to student and from week to week. These posts should summarize the work you have done that week, along with any findings. I will assign <em>additional, specific</em> content or exercises to include during some weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Your weekly update is due before class each Monday.</strong></p>
<h2>Week 9 — Conceptualization + Research</h2>
<p>Begin the work of conceptualizing your final project through primary and secondary research. This week you want to identify the broad direction of your project and look for interesting approaches to your work.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Combine desk research, field research, form studies, interviews, and other methods as fits your personal creative process. Consider running your own version of <em>7-in-7</em> or <em>Ideas in Form</em> to explore the potential of your developing project.</p>
<p>Think, read, write, make. Document your research, process, and findings.</p>
<p><strong>This is your primary assignment this week. Get your hands dirty</strong></p>
<h3>Initial Project Direction</h3>
<p>Working from your answers in Monday’s <a href="../week_9/monday.html">Project Focus Workshop</a>, create a written 250—500 description of your initial project direction.</p>
<h3>3-5 Precedents</h3>
<p>Identify and study 3-5 <em>precedents</em>. For each precedent write a 50—100 word description and collect links, images, video, and other documentation.</p>
<p>For each precedent, your description should answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the precedent? Who created it? Why did they create it?</li>
<li>How does the precedent relate to the work you will be making?</li>
<li>How does the precedent inform your project? What have you learned from it?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Due this Week</h3>
<p><strong>October 25: Precedent Show and Tell</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 29: Process Blog Post</strong></p>
<h2>Week 10 — Design Values + Proposal</h2>
<h3>Design Values</h3>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.heyimjohn.com/design-values/">John Sharp’s</a> essay on design values and consider the “qualities and characteristics you want to embody in your work.”</p>
<p>Following the example in John’s essay, develop a set of five design values. Write a title (1-6 words) and description (50-100 words) for each value.</p>
<!-- Proposal Outlining -->
<!-- Proposal Madlibs -->
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>Write a 500-1000 word project proposal outlining your intended direction for the final project.</p>
<p>It should specifically address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Context</em>: What are your areas of inquiry, what are you studying, and why?</li>
<li><em>Intention</em>: What (generally) do you plan to make, and why? How does this make a response to your inquiry?</li>
<li><em>Impact</em>: What is the goal of your project, why is it important, and why should we care?</li>
<li><em>Design Values</em>: What values will guide your process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your proposal should draw from your ongoing design research and your writing workshops and assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Your proposal must be reviewed and edited by at least one person. Credit your editor at the end of your proposal.</strong></p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a quote, properly cited. Your quote should clearly and specifically support a point in your proposal.</li>
<li>Include images of your precedents. Use captions or specific references in your writing to connect each image and precedent to your larger point.</li>
<li>Consider including other visuals and illustrations.</li>
<li>Consider how subheadings may help clarify the structure of your proposal.</li>
<li>Consider how layout and design can support your proposal.</li>
<li>Include a hook, clear introduction, and clear conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post your final proposal to your class website.</p>
<h2>Week 11 — Prototyping</h2>
<p>Consider your project carefully and identify as many outstanding questions as you can. Identify three important questions that you can answer (or partly answer) through prototyping. Design, build, test, and document <strong>at least three</strong> prototypes.</p>
<p>For each prototype answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of the prototype? What are you testing?</li>
<li>What did you learn from making your prototype?</li>
<li>What did you learn from testing your prototype?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Week 12 — User Testing</h2>
<p>Design and build a new prototype. Test your prototype with five people. Learn from their experiences through direct observation and interviewing. Document each interaction and interview as well as your findings.</p>
<h2>Week 13 — PoC Prototyping</h2>
<p>Build a full <em>Narrative Complete Product</em> / <em>Minimum Viable Product</em></p>
<h2>Week 14 — Iteration</h2>
<p>Refine your project.</p>
<h2>Week 15 — Iteration</h2>
<p>Refine your project.</p>
<h2>Week 16 — Final Crit</h2>
<p>Final Crit</p>
<h2>Week 17 — Reflection</h2>
<p>Postmortem Discussion</p>
