		<h1>Assignment 4A — Final Project</h1>
<p>The second half of the semester is dedicated to the Final Project and the related Final Paper.</p>
<h3>Final Project</h3>
<p>For your final, you will conceptualize, prototype, design, develop and document a self-directed project. The nature of this project is up to you, and should reflect your personal design interests and values.</p>
<p>You will document your process and post to your personal portfolio blog throughout this project, including summaries of your research, creative decisions, questions posed by your prototypes, outcomes and responses from testing, and production decisions. This material will due along with the final form of your project.</p>
<p><strong>You must post significant process updates each week.</strong></p>
<p>The content of these posts will vary from student to student and from week to week. These posts should summarize the work you have done that week, along with any findings. I will assign <em>additional, specific</em> content or excercises to include during some weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Your weekly update is due before class each Monday.</strong></p>
<h2>Week 9 — Conceptualization + Research</h2>
<p>Begin the work of conceptualizing your final project through primary and secondary research. This week you want to identify the broad direction of your project and look for interesting approaches to your work.</p>
<p>Combine desk research, field research, form studies, interviews, and other methods as fits your personal creative process. Think, read, write, make.</p>
<p><strong>Document your research, process, and findings.</strong></p>
<p><em>In addition</em> complete the following tasks and add them to your process blog.</p>
<h3>Initial Project Direction</h3>
<p>Answer the following questions. Each answer should be <em>at least</em> 50 words.</p>
<ul>
<li>What <em>domains</em> are you researching and investigating?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in these domains?</li>
<li>Who, specifically, will you create your work for?</li>
<li>Where and how would it most likely be experienced?</li>
<li>What is the <em>design purpose</em> of your project?</li>
<li>Why is that purpose important to you?</li>
<li>What are your primary educational goals for this class, this semester, and this program?</li>
<li>What project priorities do those goals suggest?</li>
<li>What criteria will you use to evaluate the success of your project?</li>
</ul>
<h3>3-5 Precedents</h3>
<p>Identify and study 3-5 <em>precedents</em>. For each precedent write a 50—100 word description and collect links, images, video, and other documentation.</p>
<p>For each precedent, your description should answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the precedent? Who created it? Why did they create it?</li>
<li>How does the precedent relate to the work you will be making?</li>
<li>How does the precedent inform your project? What have you learned from it?</li>
</ul>

Primary Research
Form Studies
Interviews
Surveys
Precedent Studies</p>
<h2>Week 10 — Design Values + Proposal</h2>
<h3>Design Values</h3>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.heyimjohn.com/design-values/">John Sharp’s</a> essay on design values and consider the “qualities and characteristics you want to embody in your work.”</p>
<p>Following the example in John’s essay, develop a set of five design values. Write a title (1-6 words) and description (50-100 words) for each value.</p>

<h2>Week 11 - Prototyping</h2>
<h3>Create and Test Three Prototypes</h3>
<p>Consider your project carefully and identify as many outstanding questions as you can. Identify three important questions that you can answer (or partly answer) through prototyping. Design, build, test, and document three prototypes.</p>
<p>For each prototype answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of the prototype? What are you testing?</li>
<li>What did you learn from making your prototype?</li>
<li>What did you learn from testing your prototype?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Week 12 - User Testing</h2>
<p>Design and build a new prototype. Test your prototype with five people. Learn from their experience through direct observation and interviewing. Document each interaction and interview as well as your findings.</p>
<h2>Week 13 - PoC Prototyping</h2>
<p>Build a full <em>Narrative Complete Product</em></p>
<h2>Week 14 - Iteration</h2>
<p>Refine your project.</p>
<h2>Week 15 - Iteration</h2>
<p>Refine your project.</p>
