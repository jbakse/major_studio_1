<h2>Choosing your Research Topic</h2>
<h3>Broad Topics + Focused Topics</h3>
<p>Broad topics are easier to research and boring.</p>
<p>Focused topics are harder to research and interesting.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Broad</th><th>Focused</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>The history of commercial aviation</td><td>The contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation (example from <em>Booth</em>)</td></tr>

<li>Add a middle-broad topic.</li>

</ol>

<li>Write down the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.</li>
<li>Brainstorm concepts suggested by each domain, adding them to your map.</li>
<li>Look for interesting <strong>overlaps</strong>, <strong>contrasts</strong>, and <strong>tensions</strong>; mark them on your map.</li>
