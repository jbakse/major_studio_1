		<h1>Week 2 - Wednesday</h1>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p><em>3:30 - 3:50</em></p>
<p>Arrange seats in 5 groups of 3.</p>
<h2>7 in 7 review</h2>
<p><em>3:50—4:50</em></p>
<h3>Instructor</h3>
<p>Arrange class into 5 groups.</p>
<h3>Guided Discussion</h3>
<p><em>Groups, 10 Minutes</em></p>
<p><strong>Group 1</strong>  Wei Chung + Yujie + Nicole<br>
Constraints often encourage creativity. Select two responses and discuss how their constraints contributed to their conceptualization.</p>
<p><strong>Group 2</strong>  Ting Fang + Nathan + Carla<br>
Choose set of responses that you feel composes the most coherent body of work. Discuss how these responses work together, and their emergent themes.</p>
<p><strong>Group 3</strong>  Yongqing + Minhye + George<br>
Some responses are best understood in the context of the larger project and the chosen constraints. Choose the best web presentation, and discuss how the presentation supports an understanding of the responses.</p>
<p><strong>Group 4</strong>  Wen Chi + Yasong + Leah<br>
Find two responses by different artists that have a strong conceptual similarity. Discuss this similarity.</p>
<p><strong>Group 5</strong>  Pratheek + Jin + Ruoshui<br>
Choose two responses that you feel have high potential for further development. For each response, suggest three avenues for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Class Discussion</h3>
<p><em>Class, 20 minutes</em></p>
<p>Groups lead discussion of work, starting from their assigned prompts.</p>

<li>Post your links to slack, and keep up with everyone’s posts?</li>
<li>Post your links to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/spreadsheets/d/1PUGHF2wfe7VnJfYr5eYh9nNO6ekzHLHUrzS6PIz_WQ4/edit?usp=sharing">Assignment Matrix</a>?</li>

<h2>Ideas in Form</h2>
<p><em>5:00-5:15</em></p>

<h2>Supporting your Design with Research</h2>
<p><em>5:15 - 6:00</em></p>
<p>It is common for questions to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will people understand what I’m doing?</li>
<li>Has anyone done this before?</li>
<li>How do I make this work?</li>
<li>My project is about to X. What is X?</li>
<li>What do people think about X?</li>
<li>Does anyone actually want this?</li>
<li>How much will it cost?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas for creative projects often emerge from insights gleaned from research.</p>
<p>Research is an <em>necessary tool</em> for designers who wish to make designs founded on <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<pre><code>Today <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> just practice <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> introduce these tools, you should use these tools <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> you work <span class="hljs-keyword">through</span> this—<span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">every</span>—project.

These are tools, <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> steps.

<h3>Related Readings</h3>
<p>The Craft of Research provides a great overview of how to approach academic research. I highly recommend this book. If you get it, get it in paperback so you can easily make bookmarks, highlights, and margin notes.</p>

<h2>Choosing your Research Topic</h2>
<!--
It is common for research topics to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.  -->
<h3>Domains</h3>
<p>Domains are areas of study in which a particular topic or project sits. Identifying the domains in which your project exists is important to understanding the relevant context for you work.</p>
<p>What domains were relevant to your 7-in-7 projects?</p>
<h3>Domain Mapping and Reframing</h3>
<p><em>Individual, 10 minutes</em></p>
<p>Use mapping to explore the relationships between related ideas.</p>
<p>Begin with a clean sheet of paper.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose one of your 7-in-7 responses that you feel has potential for further development.</li>
<li>Write down the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.</li>
<li>Brainstorm concepts suggested by each domain, adding them to your map.</li>
<li>Connect related concepts.</li>
<li>Look for interesting <strong>overlaps</strong>, <strong>contrasts</strong>, and <strong>tensions</strong>; mark them on your map.</li>
<li>Write down research topics suggested by these relationships.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Broad Topics + Focused Topics</h3>
<p><strong>Broad</strong> topics are easier to find sources for, harder to master, and <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> topics are harder to find sources for, easier to master, and <strong>interesting</strong>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Broad</th><th>Focused</th></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td>The history of commercial aviation</td><td>The contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation (example from <em>Booth</em>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>J-pop</td><td>How the depiction of sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos</td></tr>
<tr><td>North American Cacti</td><td>Uses of cactus needles in North American indigenous cultures.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Exploring Topic Focus</h3>
<p><em>Individual, 5 minutes</em></p>
<p>Consider the scope of your research topic. Is it too broad? Is it to narrow?</p>
<p>Begin with a clean sheet of paper.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a topic suggested by your domain mapping exercise, write that topic in the middle of your paper.</li>
<li>At the top of the page write a very broad phrasing of your topic.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page write a very narrowly focused version of your topic.</li>
<li>Add a middle-broad topic.</li>
<li>Add a middle-focused topic.</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Scope</th><th>Topic</th></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td>Super Broad</td><td>The complete history of music</td></tr>
<tr><td>Broad</td><td>Japanese culture</td></tr>
<tr><td>Moderate</td><td>J-pop idols</td></tr>
<tr><td>Specific</td><td>How the depiction of sexuality differs in J-pop and western pop music videos</td></tr>
<tr><td>Super Specific</td><td>How visual references to Satanism are used in BABYMETAL’s <em>Doki Doki Morning</em> music video.</td></tr>
</tbody>

<h3>Forming Questions</h3>
<p><em>Individual, 5 minutes</em></p>
<p>Who? What? When? Where? How? Why? Why not? What if?</p>
<h3>A Research Statement</h3>
<p><em>Individual, 5 minutes</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am studying ____1_____<br>
because I want to find out _____2_____<br>
in order to | to support making _____3______.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Start by simply stating your focused research topic.</li>
<li>Explain what you do not know.</li>
<li>Explain why it is important. What happens if you don’t find an answer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Researching your Topic</h2>

<h3>Primary Research Activities</h3>
<p><em>Class, 5 minutes</em></p>
<p>Brainstorm possible primary research activities as a class.</p>
<h2>Presenting your Findings</h2>
<p><em>6:15—6:30</em></p>
<p>You will present your findings with a 3-4 minute slide presentation.</p>
<h3>0. Plan</h3>
<p>Presenting in a short time requires planning and practice. Take the time to identify the most important information and rehearse to make sure you have time to present everything you plan to.</p>
<p>Almost all of your information should be conveyed by what you say, use slides sparingly to support what you say.</p>
<p>Don’t put any text on your slides you don’t expect us to read. Make sure you give us enough quiet time to read it.</p>
<h3>1. Hook 'em</h3>
<p>Before you get to the primary point, give us a reason to be interested.</p>
<p>A personal, relatable anecdote or a specific, thought-provoking question is often an effective opener.</p>
<h3>2. Tell 'em What You’ll Tell 'em</h3>
<p>Briefly tell us what your presentation is about, and what we will know at the end. This helps us organize the information in our heads as you deliver it. For this presentation you might do this using the research statement template. In a presentation about your project you might show your finished project first.</p>
<h3>3. Tell 'em</h3>
<p>Convey your research findings. Specifically connect everything you tell us to the larger context and your main point.</p>
<h3>4. Tell 'em what you told 'em</h3>
<p>Bring your presentation to a clear conclusion.</p>
