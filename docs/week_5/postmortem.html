		<h1>Week 5 Monday</h1>
<p>Reviewed interactive portion of Ideas in Form.</p>
<p>Student work was ambitious, most with code and/or pcomp components. Impressive work overall.</p>
<p>Introduced and discussed instruction sets. Recon Planning Workshop went well.</p>
<p>Class timing was fine.</p>
<h1>Week 5 Wednesday</h1>
<p>Pin up discussion was fine, nothing particular to report.</p>
<p>I was called away for most of the ideation workshop to address an emergency, class conducted workshop on their own. I returned near the end of the class period to check in, it seemed to go pretty well, but would have been better with a little more guidance and more time for discussion at the end.</p>
