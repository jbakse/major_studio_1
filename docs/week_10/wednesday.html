<h3>The Design Process Contains Itself: The Proposal is a Project.</h3>
<p>Think of this proposal as a project. How can you design a clear proposal that will communicate all your findings and thoughts? Consider how to employ the tools we have been working with this semester: research, precedents, sketching, outlining, iteration, testing.</p>
<p>These steps should be part of your process:</p>
<p><strong>Collect:</strong> Gather and review all your research, questions and answers, and workshop notes.</p>
<p><strong>Organize:</strong> Order and prioritize your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Write:</strong> Express your ideas, connect your thoughts, provide context for support.</p>
<p><strong>Support:</strong> Use images, video, and diagrams to make your proposal clearer and more interesting. Be sure to provide context in your text or with captions.</p>
<p><strong>Present:</strong> Use clear consistent formatting to make the organization of your proposal clear to the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Edit/Revise:</strong> Ask people to read your proposal, find out if it is clear, approachable, and complete. Work with an editor to improve your writing structure, style, and grammar.</p>
<h3>Required Content</h3>
<p>Consider the items below as a starting point. Consider how <strong>you should</strong> arrange, section, organize, and present this info to <strong>fit your specific project</strong>. You can add too this as well. For example describing your inspiration might provide a powerful introduciton.</p>
<p><strong>Intro:</strong> A short written introduction that orients the user and invites them into the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Design Questions:</strong> Two questions that will guide your process. One more specific and one more general. <strong>Don’t list! Provide Context!</strong> Use writing to introduce these questions and explain their role in your process.</p>
<p><strong>An Initial Concept:</strong> What might you make? Make it clear that this is just one option and you will be exploring.</p>
<p><strong>Audience + Context:</strong> Who is the work for? How will they experience it? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> What is the goal of your project? Why is it important? <strong>Why will others care about your work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> 2 or 3 areas of academic study, that relate directly to your questions. <strong>Don’t list! Provide Context!</strong> Connect these domains to your questions and concept. What have you learned while researching these domains that will support your project.</p>
<p><strong>Precedents:</strong> 3 to 5 relevant reference products/artworks/models <strong>Don’t list! Provide Context!</strong> Explain how each precedent can inform your work. Show images! Videos!</p>
<h3>Don’t List! Provide Context!</h3>
<p>Don’t just list your precedents, your domains, your design questions. Provide context by explaining the value of these elements in your process. Show the connections between everything you cite and your project.</p>
<h3>Your Writing Partner</h3>
<p>Work with your partner throughout your process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your current proposal with your partner now. Make notes of strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Review your first draft with your partner. Provide suggestions focused on content, organization, and support.</li>
<li>Review your final draft with your partner. Provide suggestions focused on style, spelling, and grammar.</li>
</ul>
