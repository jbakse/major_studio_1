<h2>Design Values</h2>
<p><em>4:20-5:00</em></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.heyimjohn.com/design-values/">John Sharp’s</a> essay on design values and consider the “qualities and characteristics you want to embody in your work.”</p>
<p>Following the example in John’s essay, develop a set of five design values. Write a title (1-6 words) and description (50-100 words) for each value.</p>
<p>Complete this exercise as homework.</p>
<h2>Editing Workshop</h2>
<p><em>5:00-6:30</em></p>
<p>Pair up on google docs, read each other’s papers, make notes, and discuss.</p>
<p>If you have time, repeat with other partners.</p>
<h3>Read It</h3>
<p><strong>First, read the text for general meaning</strong></p>
<p>Read for broad meaning. Do not mark corrections or note errors.</p>
<p>After each paragraph, write a small note about what the main subject or point of the paragraph. If the point is unclear, note that instead. If a sentence in the paragraph expresses that point clearly, underline it.</p>
<h3>Read it Again</h3>
<p><strong>Second, look for problems with the content.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the overall all message clear?</li>
<li>Are the <a href="../assignment_final/">required elements</a> present?</li>
<li>Are all ideas clearly connected?</li>
<li>Are claims well supported?</li>
<li>Are there examples and quotes relevant?</li>
<li>Do you think something is missing?</li>
<li>Do you think something is unnecessary?</li>
<li>Do you think something should be reordered?</li>
</ul>
<p>Make notes when find yourself asking “what does this mean?” or &quot;why is this included?
&quot;.</p>
<p>If grammar is making the sentence indecipherable, make note of it now. It may be a content issue as well.</p>
<h3>Mark Grammar, Punctuation, and Spelling</h3>
<p><strong>Thirds, maybe, mark grammar, punctuation, and spelling.</strong></p>
<p>Generally, it is better to wait until a second draft before marking grammar, punctuation, and spelling. But quick or important changes can be noted here as well.</p>
<p>In later drafts where the overall content is laid out well and well supported, you will focus on this type of feedback.</p>
