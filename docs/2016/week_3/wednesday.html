		<h1>Week 3, Wednesday September 14</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0c7p5geJZs">Clara Rockmore - (George Gershwin) Summertime</a></p>
<h1>Many Projects</h1>
<p>Working alone, create a self-directed project that builds on the research you have just completed with your team.</p>
<p>Begin by creating a new research statement which will guide your project. Choose a format/media for your project that supports your research goal. Spend most of your time creating (not planning, researching, or analyzing).</p>
<p>After you complete your project, prepare a 5 minute presentation that explains your project and addresses your research statement. For this presentation address us a studio peers already familiar with the assignment and your research project.</p>

<h3>Just Read It</h3>
<p>Read the whole text before suggesting any edits. Focus on meaning.</p>
<h3>Identify the Topic</h3>
<p>Identify the main topic of the text. You are looking to find the topic that is discussed the most, not the most interesting or best supported topic. Take a moment to briefly state this topic.</p>
<p><strong>Write the topic at the top of the paper. Try to use 5 words or fewer.</strong></p>
<h3>Identify the Thesis Statement</h3>
<p>A thesis statement states the central message of text. A strong thesis statement should be clear, concise, specific, and definite. It should also be interesting.</p>
<p>Generally, the thesis statement is placed at the end of the introduction, where it can lead in to the main body of the text.</p>
<p>Find the sentence that best states the central message, this is likely the Thesis Statement. For now, ignore strong sentences that do not state the central message.</p>
<p><strong>Highlight the thesis Statement.</strong></p>
<h3>Review the Thesis Support</h3>
<p>Read through the text again, focusing on how each sentence supports the thesis.</p>
<p>Identify weak sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentences that donâ€™t support the thesis.</li>
<li>Sentences that are <em>unhelpfully</em> redundant.</li>
<li>Sentences that equivocate (weasel words).</li>
<li>Sentences that contain no meaning, beg the question, or are tautological.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call out weak sentences with margin notes.</strong></p>
<p>Identify missing information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key information that would support the thesis.</li>
<li>Unanswered questions.</li>
<li>Missing connections between thoughts.</li>
<li>Statements that support the thesis but need support themselves. [Citation Needed]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call out missing information with margin notes.</strong></p>
<p>Identify problematic ordering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for sentences that are out of place or unrelated to adjacent sentences.</li>
<li>Look for sentences that could be moved to better support a weaker section in the text.</li>
<li>Note when topic sentences that appear in the middle of paragraphs. Usually, they should open the paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call out ordering issues with margin notes.</strong></p>
<h3>Grammar and Spelling</h3>
<p>These matter a great deal. Spelling and grammar mistakes disrupt reading and obscure meaning. Readers can often recover from simple mistakes, but will be left less confident in the writing.</p>
<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>misspellings</li>
<li>grammar problems</li>
<li>double words</li>
<li>missing words</li>
<li>incorrect punctuation</li>
<li>awkward phrasing</li>
<li>incorrect word usage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Circle mistakes, note the nature of the mistake if you think it may not be obvious.</strong></p>
