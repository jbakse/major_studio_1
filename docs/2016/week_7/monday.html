## Design Question & Core Attributes Workshop
`5:30`
<p>A design question, artistic investigation or core uncertainty is something that can describe a research domain and motivate creative practice.</p>
<p>In this workshop,</p>
<p>Please consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kinds of explorations motivate your creative practice?</li>
<li>What conceptual, aesthetic, and technical questions drive this project as a whole?</li>
<li>What are the core uncertainties of your investigation?</li>
<li>Are there key qualities, aspects or factors that you would like to describe your project or define its boundaries ? (examples: modularity, open ended construction, multiple solution form factor, participatory, alternative sensory, human computer interface etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflecting on the above issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create one list of questions / investigations.</li>
<li>Create another list of qualities / values.</li>
<li>Group the design questions as you see fit: in terms of concept, aesthetics, audience participation and technical means of creation</li>
<li>Rank your questions in order of importance within their groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with a partner, suggest any new questions to both of your lists as needed. Question everything, particularly things you think you already know (rather than make assumptions).  Make sure to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who? (co-designers, collaborators, users, participants, audience)</li>
<li>Where?</li>
<li>When?</li>
<li>Why? (are you making this, why now, why for these people)</li>
<li>Why you? (what is your unique POV, contribution, access etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Core attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are key qualities, aesthetics, attributes or adjectives you would like to be associated with the work?</li>
<li>What are the tensions, contradictions, gaps, surprises; or the unusual juxtapositions, ironies or patterns youâ€™ve encountered in your research and making?</li>
<li>What kind of experience do you want people to have who engage with this work?</li>
<li>Ultimately, what problem are you trying to solve (if design-oriented)? What are you trying express, convey, explore or facilitate (if art-focused)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Synthesize, write up any unexpected findings, post to the class blog. --&gt;</p>
